## Goals

- Define a shared target-scoped request model for local operations that need to address one or more designator paths.
- Implement that target model first on the local `weave` CLI surface, while shaping it so existing local `version`, `validate`, and `generate` runtime seams and later standalone surfaces can reuse it.
- Keep shared targeting resource-root based: target logical designator-root resources, not support artifacts directly.
- Define recursion and overlap behavior for targets so later multi-target operations can remain deterministic.

## Summary

This task should define the first shared targeting model for local Weave operations before Markdown payload publishing broadens the public artifact surface.

The intended first boundary is:

- introduce a target-scoped request shape that can later be reused by standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate` operations
- apply that request model end-to-end to `weave` first, because `weave` is the current first-class CLI operation that already composes versioning, validation, and generation behavior
- keep targets resource-root based, for example `alice`, `alice/bio`, `ontology`, or `ontology/shacl`
- reject support-artifact-only explicit targets such as `_mesh/_inventory`, `alice/_knop/_meta`, or `alice/_knop/_references` in the first pass
- leave payload history/state naming to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]]

The motivating publication examples are target roots such as `ontology` and `ontology/shacl`, which later version-oriented operations may version under paths such as `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ontology-ttl/ontology.ttl`.

## Discussion

The broader architecture language also talks about `version`, `validate`, and `generate`. Those now exist as local runtime seams, but they are not yet settled standalone CLI surfaces. In the current local CLI, versioning, RDF validation, and page generation are still effectively composed through `weave`.

So this task should do two things without conflating them:

- define the shared target model that later standalone operations can reuse
- implement that model only where it is currently real, which is `weave`

Target selection also needs to stay coherent as `WeaveRequest` moves from a flat `designatorPaths` list to target-scoped objects.

“Resource-root based” in this note means designator-root resources that own a Knop-managed surface, not their internal support artifacts. In practice, the first targeting model should address roots such as:

- `alice`
- `alice/bio`
- `ontology`
- `ontology/shacl`

and let each operation derive owned support-artifact work from those roots.

The current selection model is:

- no explicit designator paths means "all weaveable candidates"
- explicit designator paths are exact-match only

For the first `targets` contract, recursion should be supported from the start, but not implicitly. A target should be exact-match unless it opts into recursive selection.

That means overlap behavior must be explicit. The intended rule is:

- the most specific matching target wins
- "most specific" means the longest normalized matching `designatorPath`
- if two matching targets have the same normalized `designatorPath`, the request is ambiguous and should fail closed rather than depending on input order

## Open Issues

- None currently blocking the first implementation pass.

## Decisions

- Shared targeting should remain resource-root based in the first pass; no support-artifact-only explicit targets.
- The first implementation should cut straight to target-scoped request objects rather than introducing scalar naming fields or support-artifact path targeting that would need to be backed out immediately.
- The first implementation should carry the new `targets` shape all the way through `core/weave`, `runtime/weave`, and the CLI, but keep runtime and CLI changes as thin pass-through plumbing over the core contract rather than a separate surface redesign.
- This task defines a shared target model intended for later standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate` surfaces, but those standalone operations are not implemented here.
- The first concrete implementation scope is `weave`, because that is the current operation where versioning, validation, and generation behavior are already composed.
- Target-scoped recursion should be supported from the start rather than deferred to a later redesign.
- Explicit targets remain exact-match by default; recursion is opt-in per target.
- When multiple targets match the same weave candidate, the most specific matching target wins.
- If multiple matching targets have the same normalized `designatorPath`, the request should fail closed as ambiguous.
- The first CLI syntax should be a repeatable `--target <key=value,...>` flag that maps directly to one target object; in this task the supported keys are `designatorPath` and optional `recursive`.
- Payload `historySegment` and `stateSegment` are not part of the shared target model; they belong to version-oriented requests as captured in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]].
- Broader multi-target version orchestration should follow the `validate/version/generate` decomposition rather than being forced into the current single-candidate `weave` planner first.

## Contract Changes

- The first concrete contract change is in `WeaveRequest`, which should become target-scoped.
- The same target specification shape should be reusable later by standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate` requests if and when those surfaces are introduced.
- `runtime/weave` should accept the same target-scoped request shape and pass it through without reinterpretation.
- The CLI `weave` command should accept a repeatable `--target <key=value,...>` syntax for one or more target specifications and translate that syntax directly into the `targets` request shape.
- `WeaveRequest` should move to a list of target specifications such as:
  - `designatorPath`
  - optional `recursive`
- For this task, `weave --target` should expose only shared targeting fields rather than version-only naming fields.
- When `recursive` is true, the target applies to matching descendant payload designator paths as well as the exact path.
- When more than one target matches a candidate, the winner is the matching target with the longest normalized `designatorPath`.
- If more than one matching target has the same normalized `designatorPath`, planning should fail closed rather than using request order as a precedence rule.
- In the first pass, support-artifact-only explicit targets such as `_mesh/_inventory`, `alice/_knop/_meta`, or `alice/_knop/_references` should be rejected.
- Version-specific payload naming options belong to version-oriented requests, not to `TargetSpec`.

## Testing

- Keep all current tests green when no explicit targets are supplied.
- Add core coverage for exact-match target selection.
- Add core coverage for recursive target selection over descendant resource roots.
- Add core coverage for overlapping recursive and exact targets resolving by most-specific target.
- Add runtime and CLI coverage proving the `targets` request shape reaches `core/weave` intact.
- Add explicit coverage for default target selection semantics on `weave`, because that is the first implementation-bearing consumer of the shared target model.
- Add coverage proving recursive targets apply to descendant resource roots rather than support-artifact paths.
- Add coverage proving duplicate targets at the same specificity fail closed as ambiguous.
- Add coverage proving support-artifact-only explicit targets are rejected.
- Leave payload history/state naming coverage to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]].

## Non-Goals

- Implementing standalone `version`, `validate`, or `generate` commands in this task.
- Implementing payload history/state naming in this task.
- Support-artifact-only targeting in this task.
- Solving generic multi-history policy for every artifact type at once.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Refine `WeaveRequest` to use target-scoped request objects instead of `designatorPaths`.
- [x] Define target matching semantics, including exact versus recursive targets and the most-specific-wins precedence rule.
- [x] Keep the target specification shape narrow and reusable so later standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate` surfaces can adopt it without a second redesign.
- [x] Reject support-artifact-only explicit targets in the first pass.
- [x] Thread the new `targets` request shape through `runtime/weave` as a thin pass-through to `core/weave`.
- [x] Add repeatable `--target <key=value,...>` CLI parsing for one or more named `targets`, translating directly into the runtime/core request shape without broader CLI redesign.
- [x] Add core, runtime, integration, and CLI coverage for default targeting, exact targets, recursive targets, ambiguous overlaps, and support-artifact rejection.
