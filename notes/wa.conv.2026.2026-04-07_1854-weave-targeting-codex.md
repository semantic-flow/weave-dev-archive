weave targeting

I think we're ready to pick up [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]] -- please review. Help me decide the open issue.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1756_00

I’m reviewing the targeting task note in repo context first. I’ll read the product vision, the general guidance note, and the task note, then trace any related implementation/docs needed to resolve the open decision.

I have the task note context. Next I’m checking the existing `weave` request/CLI shape and a couple of repo guidance notes so the recommendation is anchored in what already exists rather than inventing a fresh surface.

The repo already contains a targeting layer, so I’m checking whether the remaining “open issue” is actually already answered in code. If it is, the decision should match that implementation or the note should be tightened to reflect a deliberate correction.

I hit a trivial `rg` flag quoting mistake. I’m rerunning the search and reading the CLI/runtime pieces that actually expose the syntax, because that’s the real determinant of whether the note’s open question is still open.

The later task note already settled the broader decomposition, which narrows this one: the open question is just the first CLI spelling. I’m reading the actual CLI parser now to see what the least-surprising syntax is in this codebase, not in the abstract.

The CLI is still bare `weave` with no target flags at all. I’m checking existing test style for command-line parsing, because the right answer should be the minimum addition that fits how this repo already tests command UX.

The core tests already encode one important design choice: support-artifact paths are rejected at normalization time, not later in planning. I’m verifying where that comes from, because it affects how thin the CLI parser can be.

There’s no existing CLI target flag. That means the decision is still real, but the answer should stay narrowly scoped so it doesn’t accidentally become a general CLI redesign. I’m reading the runtime normalization path to see what parser shape would be almost a direct pass-through into `request.targets`.

I have enough code context to make the call, but I’m checking one earlier design thread that already discussed target spelling. If there’s an existing argument in-repo, the task note should align with it rather than rediscover it.

I’ve narrowed it. The note is basically ready; the remaining choice is whether the CLI should mirror the target object directly or invent a one-off shorthand. I’m pulling exact line references for the recommendation so it’s easy to update the note cleanly.

The main design recommendation is solid now. I’m doing one last pass over the `validate`/`version`/`generate` tests, because if those contracts are already real in code then the CLI syntax should avoid boxing them into a dead end.

The note is ready enough to implement. The one thing I’d tighten is that its discussion is slightly stale: standalone `validate` / `version` / `generate` already exist as runtime seams in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts:121](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and the shared target model already exists in [src/core/targeting.ts:6](../../src/core/targeting.ts). What’s still missing is the CLI surface in [src/cli/run.ts:51](../../src/cli/run.ts) and the note’s open issue at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]].

My recommendation is:

```sh
weave \
  --target 'designatorPath=alice/bio' \
  --target 'designatorPath=ontology,recursive=true'
```

Use a repeatable `--target <spec>` flag, where `<spec>` is a thin comma-separated `key=value` map that mirrors the request object. For this task, support only `designatorPath` and optional `recursive=true`.

I would not do `--recursive-target`, positional mini-languages, or JSON blobs right now. Those look simpler, but they create a CLI-only contract that diverges from the actual target object shape and will need redesign once version-oriented fields matter. The explicit `key=value` form is a little clunky, but it is the thinnest real pass-through to `request.targets`, which is exactly what the task note says it wants at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]].

If you want, I can patch the note to record that decision and then wire up the CLI parser/tests.

# User_2026-04-07_1801_01

yes, proceed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1801_22

I’m implementing the settled CLI path now: record the decision in the note, add a repeatable `--target` parser on bare `weave`, and cover exact and recursive targeting in CLI tests. After the edits I’ll run lint and the targeted tests.

I’m checking the current worktree before editing so I don’t trample unrelated changes. Then I’ll patch the CLI and docs in one pass.

I found only one unrelated modified file in the worktree, so I can stay clear of it. Before I patch, I’m checking whether the weave behavior spec needs a small update too, since this is an externally visible CLI change.

The weave spec is intentionally not a CLI-design note, so I’m keeping the doc edits focused on the task note and decision log rather than spraying syntax details across unrelated specs. I’m checking Cliffy’s option API once so the `--target` flag lands cleanly instead of guessing.

I found one thing worth fixing while I’m here: targeted `executeWeave()` is not actually forwarding targets into `generate`, so the runtime isn’t fully honoring the task note yet. I’m folding that into the patch because otherwise the new CLI would only be half-real.

I’ve got the change surface now. I’m patching four things together so they stay coherent: the root CLI parser, the `executeWeave()` target pass-through into `generate`, black-box CLI coverage, and the task/decision docs that settle the syntax.

I’m updating the task note now to close the open issue explicitly and to correct the stale statement about `validate` / `version` / `generate` not existing at runtime. After that I’ll add the decision-log entry.

The core edits are in. I’m reading the changed sections back before I run tests so I can catch any contract mismatch in the parser or the target pass-through without wasting a full test cycle.

There’s one semantic edge I’m validating before the test run: whether targeting `alice/bio` should still regenerate `alice/index.html` because the parent page changed across the settled fixtures. If it does, passing targets into `generate` naively would be too aggressive a narrowing.

I’m in verification now. I’m formatting the touched TypeScript, then running `check`, `lint`, and the weave integration/e2e tests that exercise the new CLI parser and the runtime target pass-through.

`check` and `lint` are through the front door. I’m waiting on the weave integration/e2e run now; if anything fails it will likely be around the exact scope question I flagged for targeted `generate`.

The code path is green. I’m doing the last bookkeeping pass now: mark the completed task-note checkboxes and confirm the final diff/worktree state before I hand back the outcome.

The targeted suite is green. I’m running the full test task once because this touched the shared weave path and the root CLI, and that’s the point where a narrow test run can miss collateral breakage.

The full suite is still running. If it trips, I expect it to be from another CLI path inheriting the new root option parsing or from weave page-generation assumptions; otherwise this should close cleanly.

Implemented the targeting CLI and closed the note’s open issue.

In [src/cli/run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts), bare `weave` now accepts repeatable `--target <key=value,...>` flags. For this task it supports `designatorPath` and optional `recursive`, and it rejects version-only fields instead of inventing a separate CLI model. In [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), `executeWeave()` now forwards shared targets into `generate` as well as `validate`, so targeted weave is actually end-to-end. Coverage was added in [tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts) and [tests/integration/weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts).

I also settled the docs in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]], recorded the decision in [[wd.decision-log]], and updated [[wd.codebase-overview]]. I left the pre-existing unrelated edit in [[wa.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1621-weave-validate-version-generate-codex]] untouched.

Verification ran cleanly: `deno task check`, `deno task lint`, and `deno task test` all passed.

# User_2026-04-07_1847_09

So we can name histories and states?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1847_27

I’m checking the actual code path for `historySegment` and `stateSegment` before answering, because there’s a difference between “accepted by the type” and “actually used to shape output paths.”

I’m checking whether those naming fields are merely accepted or actually drive path generation. The current tests suggest acceptance alone, which would be misleading if the implementation still hardcodes `_history001` / `_s0001`.

I’m pulling exact line numbers for the answer so the distinction is concrete: accepted in the contract, rejected on the CLI, and still hardcoded in the actual planner.

Not really. The code is only half there.

Current status:

- The version-side request types can carry `historySegment` and `stateSegment` in [targeting.ts#L11](../../src/core/targeting.ts#L11).
- `validate` and `generate` reject them by design, and the root `weave --target` CLI does not expose them at all; it only accepts `designatorPath` and `recursive` in [run.ts#L60](../../src/cli/run.ts#L60).
- More importantly, the actual planner still hardcodes `_history001` and `_s0001` in [weave.ts#L3628](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3628).
- The proof is in the test: `executeVersion()` is given `historySegment: "releases"` and `stateSegment: "v0.0.1"`, but it still expects the created path `alice/bio/_history001/_s0001/...` in [validate_version_generate_test.ts#L60](../../tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts#L60).

So the boundary is prepared, but custom history/state naming is not implemented end-to-end yet.

If we do that next, it should land in `version` planning first, not as extra fields on `weave --target`.

# User_2026-04-07_1851_12

So a new task note? please create.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1851_34

I’m checking the task-note template and nearby notes first so the new note follows the repo’s conventions and doesn’t duplicate an existing task boundary unnecessarily.

I’ve confirmed the existing `0820` note still bundles too much. I’m creating a narrower task note for making payload history/state naming real end-to-end, without reopening the shared-targeting decision or stuffing version-only fields into `weave --target`.

I’m creating the note as a narrow follow-on to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]]: make payload history/state naming real in `version`/`weave`, but keep it out of the shared-target CLI surface for now.

Created [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming]].

It scopes the next step narrowly: make `historySegment` and `stateSegment` actually affect payload versioning in `version`/programmatic `weave`, preserve current defaults when omitted, fail closed on mismatched existing histories, and keep those fields out of the shared `weave --target` CLI surface.

I did not touch your existing modified files in the worktree. No tests ran; this was a note-only change.

# User_2026-04-07_1854_11

does [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]] need any updates? Any additional issues surfaced?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1854_55

I’m checking one part before I answer definitively: whether the note’s recursive-version batching decision is actually reflected in code yet, or whether that’s still future intent.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1855_33

Yes, but mostly as a status-sync, not a redesign.

I’d update [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) in three places:

- The discussion is now stale. Local runtime seams do exist: `executeValidate()`, `executeVersion()`, and `executeGenerate()` are real in [weave.ts#L121](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L121), [weave.ts#L156](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L156), and [weave.ts#L184](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L184). The note should say “standalone CLI surfaces are not settled yet,” not “these are not first-class operations yet.”
- It should cross-reference the new follow-on naming task, [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md), because `historySegment` / `stateSegment` are still contract-only, not semantically effective. The planner still hardcodes payload paths in [weave.ts#L3628](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3628), and the test still expects `_history001/_s0001` even when custom names are passed in [validate_version_generate_test.ts#L60](../../tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts#L60).
- It should record the now-settled CLI boundary: root `weave --target` is shared-target-only and intentionally does not expose version-only naming fields, as implemented in [run.ts#L60](../../src/cli/run.ts#L60).

The additional issue that surfaced is more important than the naming one: recursive `version` batching is still not real. `planVersion()` just delegates to `planWeave()` in [weave.ts#L243](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L243), and `planWeave()` still fails if more than one weave candidate is selected in [weave.ts#L180](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L180). So the note’s “batch recursive version planning” decision is still aspirational, not implemented.

So: yes, update it. The main new surfaced issues are:

- payload history/state naming is not implemented end-to-end yet
- recursive multi-target `version` batching is still unresolved in core

If you want, I can patch the `0820` note to reflect that cleanly.

# User_2026-04-07_1857_32

yes please. weave CLI should accept payload history/state naming fields, but just pass them on to "version"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1857_52

I’m updating the `0820` note as a status sync plus your new design call: `weave` CLI may accept payload history/state naming, but those remain version-oriented inputs and should not be treated as shared target fields. I’m checking the exact sections to patch so this doesn’t conflict with the targeting note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1858_43

I’m patching both notes so they agree on the new boundary: `weave --target` stays shared-target-only, but the root `weave` CLI may still accept separate payload naming inputs and pass them only to `version`. I’m also marking the status drift and the recursive-batch gap explicitly in `0820`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1859_27

Updated [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) and aligned [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md).

The note now reflects three things:

- local `validate` / `version` / `generate` seams already exist, so the remaining work is implementation and CLI boundary, not conceptual decomposition
- payload `historySegment` / `stateSegment` are still an implementation gap, tracked explicitly in the `1852` note
- root `weave` may accept payload history/state naming as separate version-oriented CLI inputs, but shared `weave --target` stays limited to shared targeting fields and should not absorb them

I also recorded the additional surfaced issue in `0820`: recursive multi-target `version` batching is still not real because `planVersion(...)` still rides the single-candidate `planWeave(...)` path.

No tests ran; this was a note-only update.

# User_2026-04-07_2005_13

OK, what's next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2005_31

Next should be [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md).

That is the cleanest next move because:

- the shared targeting work in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) is materially settled
- `validate` / `version` / `generate` seams exist, but `historySegment` and `stateSegment` are still fake-contract fields
- implementing payload naming is contained and directly useful for publication flows
- recursive multi-target `version` batching from [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) is broader and should come after the naming contract is truthful

Concretely, I’d do this next:

1. Make payload `historySegment` / `stateSegment` actually affect `version` planning.
2. Add root `weave` CLI pass-through flags for those version-only inputs, separate from `--target`.
3. Keep `weave --target` shared-target-only.
4. Add tests for first-payload and second-payload naming plus mismatched-history failure.

After that, the next task is the bigger one: recursive multi-target `version` batching in `core`.

If you want, I can start implementing the `1852` task now.

# User_2026-04-07_2006_26

yes please, proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2006_48

I’m implementing the payload version-naming task now. First I’m reading the note and tracing where payload history/state paths are still hardcoded in `core`, `runtime`, and the root `weave` CLI so I can change the real contract instead of just widening types again.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2006_56

I’m checking the worktree and the concrete payload-version code paths now. The key thing I need to pin down is whether naming only affects payload history/state paths or whether any helper currently assumes `_history001` deeply enough that it also breaks page generation or validation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_02

I’ve got the hardcoded hotspots. Next I’m reading the first- and second-payload weave planners plus the current CLI root parser so I can thread naming through the smallest stable seam instead of patching string literals blindly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_06

I’m drilling into the payload-shape assertions now. The risky part is not writing the new snapshot path; it’s all the RDF and page helpers that currently assume the history lives specifically at `D/_history001`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_10

The first and second payload planners are the real center of gravity. I’m reading the payload-specific RDF renderers now, because the request won’t be truthful until the emitted inventory RDF, created files, and generated page paths all agree on the same custom history/state segments.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_17

The inventory resolver is another dependency here: second-payload planning has to discover the existing payload history segment from current Knop inventory, not just assume `_history001`. I’m reading that resolver next because otherwise the “mismatched historySegment fails closed” rule won’t have a solid source of truth.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_28

The inventory resolver already gives me enough to avoid guessing the current payload history path. I’m now patching the payload planning around that source of truth, including one side-effect fix: extracted-resource weave should stop assuming source payload histories always live under `_history001`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_40

I have the implementation seam now: payload history naming mostly lives in the KnopInventory renderer and payload page builders, with runtime reads derived from current inventory. I’m checking the existing core tests next so I can extend them rather than fighting the fixture-heavy integration layer first.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2007_51

I’ve hit the first real design edge: if someone passes payload naming while targeting a Knop-only weave slice, silently ignoring it would be wrong. I’m tracing how the matched target spec reaches the planner so I can make that fail closed per target instead of as a loose CLI validation rule.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2008_15

I found another hidden dependency: payload naming isn’t just file-path creation. `detectPendingWeaveSlice()` still uses `_history001` / `_s0001` to decide whether a payload is on its first or second weave. I’m tracing whether page generation uses the same assumptions or only reads whatever inventory RDF says, because that determines how broad the core refactor has to be.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2009_30

I’m picking up the payload naming task now. I’m re-reading the task note and the relevant planner/runtime seams, then I’ll wire the root `weave` CLI to pass separate payload naming flags through `version` without widening shared `--target`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2009_35

I’ve confirmed the contract note and the current seams. Next I’m tracing every payload-only `_history001`/`_sNNNN` assumption so I can change the narrow slice without disturbing mesh or Knop support-artifact naming.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2009_47

I have the hardcoded surface mapped now. The main work is not just path helpers; the planner currently throws away per-target naming, so I’m fixing target propagation first and then I’ll replace payload-only history/state assumptions in planning, RDF, runtime snapshot loading, and CLI tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2010_02

The narrow implementation plan is set: add separate root CLI flags, carry selected target naming into the payload planner, derive payload history/state paths from either the request or current inventory, then update the core/runtime tests around first payload, second payload, and mismatch rejection.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2013_01

I’ve got the shape change pinned down. I’m editing `core/weave` now in one pass so the target propagation, payload path derivation, and payload-only validation all stay consistent instead of landing as piecemeal fixes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2015_10

The core planner edits are in. I’m switching to the runtime/CLI seam now so the workspace loader and the root `weave` command actually exercise the new payload naming paths instead of still assuming `_history001`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2016_01

The code path is wired end to end now, but I expect type and test fallout because the payload artifact shape changed and a few page/render helpers moved to dynamic paths. I’m running a narrow test compile next so I can fix the actual breakage instead of guessing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2017_52

The test expectations are updated now. I’m formatting the touched files before the next run so the remaining failures are semantic, not formatting noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2018_07

The remaining failures are mostly permission-related from the fixture loader using `git`. I’m re-running with the repo’s normal test permissions so I can see the real regressions.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2019_57

The code path is green on the focused tests. I’m doing the repo-level verification next and then I’ll sync the task note with the actual implemented boundary so the note doesn’t drift from the code again.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2020_21

Repo-wide verification is running. The focused weave tests are already green; I’m just waiting on the full `check` and `test` tasks so I can close this out with the final state instead of a partial pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2021_35

Implemented payload version naming in [src/core/weave/weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and [src/cli/run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts). `historySegment` and `stateSegment` now actually drive payload history/state paths for `executeVersion()` and composed `executeWeave()`, mismatched `historySegment` fails closed once a payload history already exists, and extracted-page links now follow the real source payload history instead of hardcoding `_history001`. Shared `weave --target` still only accepts shared fields; the root CLI now exposes separate `--payload-history-segment` and `--payload-state-segment` flags, and they require exactly one `--target`.

Coverage was added in [src/core/weave/weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), [tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts](../../tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts), [tests/integration/weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and [tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts). I also synced [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md) to the implemented boundary.

Verification passed:
- `deno task check`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task test`

I left your unrelated worktree edits in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md), [wd.general-guidance.md](wd.general-guidance.md), and [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) untouched.

# User_2026-04-07_2036_29

I'm not sure I thought through payload-history-segment adequately. The idea originally was to support multiple histories, like maybe a releases history vs a working history. Can you specify a new history at every weave, or only on the first one? If you can have multiple histories, you should be able to specify a new payload-history-segment and re-weave even if the file hasn't changed? And we decided to track the "current" history? Or maybe we didn't. But if payload-history-segment isn't specified on weave, it should just re-use the most recent one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2036_52

I’m checking the implemented semantics against the code rather than hand-waving here. I want to separate what the current code actually does from what your broader multi-history model would require.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2036_59

I have the actual behavior now. Short version: the current implementation does not support arbitrarily opening a new payload history on each weave. It supports choosing the first history name, then sticking to the current one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2037_36

Current behavior is narrower than the model you just described.

Right now:

- On the first payload weave, `payload-history-segment` can name the initial payload history; otherwise it defaults to `_history001` in [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3711](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3711).
- On a later payload weave, if a current payload history already exists, a provided `payload-history-segment` must match that current history or the weave fails closed in [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3726](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3726).
- If `payload-history-segment` is omitted on a later weave, the code reuses the current payload history from inventory in [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3731](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L3731).
- Yes, we do track a current history. The payload RDF writes both `sflo:hasArtifactHistory` and `sflo:currentArtifactHistory` in [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2220](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2220) and again for the second payload state in [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2520](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2520).

So the answer to your direct question is: you cannot specify a new history at every weave in the current implementation. You can only name the first one, or later restate the same current one.

The bigger issue is that true multi-history payload versioning is not implemented yet. If you want `releases` vs `working`, then the model needs to support:

- multiple payload `hasArtifactHistory` entries
- one explicit `currentArtifactHistory`
- a rule for whether `--payload-history-segment foo` means “append to existing `foo`” or “create and switch current history to `foo`”
- a rule for unchanged-content reweaves

On that last point, I would not make unchanged-content reweaves implicit. If switching histories or creating a new history on identical bytes is allowed, it should be explicit, because otherwise `weave` stops being meaningfully idempotent.

The clean semantics would be:

1. If no payload history exists yet, omitted `payload-history-segment` creates `_history001`; provided one creates that history and makes it current.
2. If a payload history exists and no `payload-history-segment` is given, weave appends to the current history.
3. If a different `payload-history-segment` is given and that history exists, weave switches to it and appends there.
4. If a different `payload-history-segment` is given and it does not exist, weave creates it and makes it current.
5. Creating a new historical state with unchanged payload bytes should require an explicit force-style flag or a separate version operation.

That is a different task than what we just implemented. The current code is “single current payload history with optional custom name,” not “multiple payload histories.”

If you want, I can write the follow-on task note for true multi-history payload versioning and pin down the switching semantics before we touch code.

# User_2026-04-07_2043_49

That's okay, let me think about it some more.

What's next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2044_05

I’m checking the current task stack against the roadmap so the recommendation is based on the repo’s own sequencing, not just my preference.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2044_25

Two sensible “next” options emerged, and they are different kinds of work.

If you want the next product-facing feature, the roadmap already says the near-term item is HTML payload support in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md): “support HTML as DigitalArtifact that can still be optionally chromed.” That is the cleanest next user-visible capability.

If you want to keep finishing the weave/version plumbing first, the next engineering gap is recursive multi-target `version` batching from [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md). That is still unresolved, and unlike multi-history payloads, the semantics are already mostly decided.

I would not do “true multiple payload histories” next. The roadmap’s “Multiple histories” section is still exploratory, and the model questions you just raised are real. That should stay in note/design mode until the semantics are explicit.

So my recommendation is:

1. If you want feature progress: write a task note for HTML-as-DigitalArtifact with optional chrome.
2. If you want architectural cleanup first: implement recursive multi-target `version` batching.
3. Leave multiple payload histories for later, after a dedicated design note settles switching/current-history/idempotence rules.

If you want, I can draft the HTML task note next.

# User_2026-04-07_2054_19

HTML support is mostly around using generate on HTML to (optionally) put chrome on it. But it maybe deserves a litle more thought. Like when an HTML file references a CSS file, does it reference the working file? (Probably). It's for the case where you want a generate semantic site to be generated not (completely) from markdown files. 

But what's really bothering me right now... I was assuming, nay excited, that Working LocatedFiles could live outside the mesh in a docs-dir-based mesh. But if it's outside it can't be exposed, and we don't have a "latest" convenience version inside the mesh (anymore.) Do we have to bring that back? Or at least make it an option?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2054_37

I’m checking the ontology and current weave assumptions around `WorkingLocatedFile` and current/latest exposure. I want to answer from the actual model and code, because this is one of those places where a small modeling shortcut can box the whole site layout in later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2054_47

I’m pulling the ontology definitions too, because this question is really about whether the current RDF contract distinguishes “working source” from “public current surface” strongly enough.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2054_52

I found the current model edges. The ontology gives you `hasWorkingLocatedFile` and `currentArtifactHistory`, but it does not currently give you a first-class “current published file” inside the mesh distinct from the working file. That’s the real tension you’re feeling.

# User_2026-04-07_2054_56

Or just require a whole-repo based mesh if you need the WorkingLocatedFile to be accessible.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2055_13

I’m checking one narrow thing before I answer: whether the current runtime already hard-requires mesh-relative working files, or whether that’s mostly a modeling preference right now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2055_53

I’m grabbing exact line references for the ontology/runtime constraint so I can be concrete about what is “current implementation” versus “recommended direction.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2057_00

As a temporary implementation rule, yes. As the long-term model, no.

The ontology already treats `hasWorkingLocatedFile` as an authoring/current shortcut, not as “the public current bytes.” In the vendored ontology, it is explicitly for “sparse authoring support without materializing working/current state resources” in [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L137](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L137). And `currentArtifactHistory` points to the default history for further versioning, not to a public current file in [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L86](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L86).

The problem is the current implementation does bake in the stronger assumption:
- runtime inventory resolution only accepts mesh-relative paths for working files in [inventory.ts#L326](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L326)
- generated identifier pages link directly to the working file in [pages.ts#L31](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L31)

So if you want to move fast, “current local runtime requires mesh-relative working files” is a reasonable short-term constraint. That effectively means whole-repo-based mesh, or at least “working files must live under the mesh base subtree.”

But I would not elevate that into the semantic rule. If docs-dir-based meshes are real, then forcing `hasWorkingLocatedFile` to be publicly reachable collapses two distinct things:
- authoring/source location
- published current bytes inside the mesh

My recommendation is:

- Short term: document the current constraint honestly as mesh-relative `hasWorkingLocatedFile` only.
- Medium term: add a separate current/public surface inside the mesh.
  - smallest step: optional generated `latest` alias/copy
  - cleaner step: a distinct `currentLocatedFile` or `currentManifestation` concept
- Do not make `hasWorkingLocatedFile` carry both meanings.

That same distinction is going to matter for HTML too. If a working HTML file lives outside the public mesh, then CSS/asset references raise exactly the same question: are they authoring references, or public published references?

So: yes, whole-repo-based mesh is acceptable as a temporary rule. No, I would not make it the permanent answer if split source/public layouts are important.

# User_2026-04-07_2121_20

for now, proceed with [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md)

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2121_35

I’m picking up the `validate/version/generate` task directly now. First I’m checking what parts of that note are still unimplemented in the current code so I don’t blindly push the wrong slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2121_59

The big unresolved piece in that note is still recursive multi-target `version`, and that one is not just a checkbox update. I’m tracing the actual planning interactions first, because naive “loop over targets” will produce wrong mesh-inventory states.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2122_12

I’m checking the planner output shape next, because batch versioning only works cleanly if I can maintain a virtual current state between candidates without accidentally dragging page generation back into `version`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2123_07

I’m picking up the `0820` task as implementation work, not just note maintenance. First I’m re-reading the task note and the current planner/runtime surfaces so I can isolate the remaining gap and patch the right slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2123_10

The task note has narrowed down quite a bit since the earlier pass. What’s actually left is the recursive multi-target `version` batch path, so I’m reading the planner and its existing tests with that assumption instead of reworking already-settled seams.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2123_27

The planner confirms the remaining problem: `version` is still just `planWeave()` with `.html` filtered out, so recursive selection immediately trips the single-candidate guard. I’m digging one layer deeper now to see whether batching can be done by reusing the slice planners with a virtual mesh state, or whether the candidate loader also needs a staged-state path.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2123_36

I’ve confirmed the core constraint isn’t just target selection; mesh inventory state advances between slices. That means the safe implementation is a staged batch planner: compute the whole recursive `version` plan in memory, mutate a virtual current state between candidates, and only write after the entire batch succeeds.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2125_23

I’m at the test-design step now. I need one fixture state where recursive targeting naturally selects more than one pending resource, so I’m checking the carried Alice/Bob branches instead of fabricating a brittle synthetic mesh unless I have to.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2128_46

I’ve got the implementation shape. I’m editing the runtime batch planner now so `version` can stage multiple targeted resources in memory, advance a virtual current state between them, and still fail before any writes if a later target becomes invalid.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2129_25

The first patch didn’t land cleanly because a couple of runtime read sites have drifted. I’m refreshing the exact function bodies and then I’ll apply the batch planner in smaller, safer edits.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2131_17

I’ve got the runtime batch path in place. I’m adding two integration checks now: one happy-path recursive batch that stages `alice` then `alice/bio`, and one fail-closed batch that proves a later target can invalidate under staged state without any files being written.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2133_18

The batch planner and coverage are in. I’m formatting and running the targeted test files first so I can catch type or behavioral drift before I touch the task note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2133_26

The code compiles so far; the integration runs are still active. I’m waiting on the actual behavior now, especially the negative batch case where the staged source state should invalidate the later extracted target.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2133_37

The direct `deno test` invocations hit the repo’s usual permission issue: these tests need the task wrapper’s flags, not the bare runner. I’m rerunning through the project task entrypoint so we get a real behavioral result instead of a sandbox false negative.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2134_21

The recursive `weave` test flushed out the real edge: the staged batch logic works, but the first-knop mesh-inventory renderer is still slice-hardcoded and drops unrelated existing Knops. I’m inspecting those mesh-inventory renderers now, because without preserving existing entries the batch planner can’t carry descendants forward.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2136_55

The runtime failure turned out to be a real core bug, not a test artifact: the first-knop mesh-inventory renderer was throwing away other Knops entirely. I’m fixing that in core now by making the early mesh-inventory renders preserve existing mesh entries instead of hardcoding a single-designator snapshot.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2139_03

I fixed the underlying core issue as well: early mesh-inventory renders now preserve existing mesh blocks instead of regenerating a single-designator world. I’m reformatting and rerunning the targeted tests against that version before I widen to the full suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2139_30

The batch path itself is holding; the positive fixture was just missing one required pre-weave fact. I only injected the descendant Knop into mesh inventory, but first-payload planning also requires the descendant payload artifact block there, so I’m fixing the synthetic workspace setup rather than the planner.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2140_15

The regex filter is unreliable with this task wrapper, so it’s reporting everything as filtered out. I’m running the affected integration files directly through the task entrypoint now so we get actual executed tests, not a misleading green no-op.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2140_38

The core tests exposed two more real assumptions. Some planner fixtures are intentionally minimal, so the new block-preserving renderers need to tolerate inventories without a full `_mesh` block or without certain page blocks, and the positive integration assertions are now too strict about exact block order. I’m tightening both ends instead of backing out the generalization.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2143_06

The core fallback is in and the synthetic recursive assertions are loosened to semantic facts instead of exact block order. I’m rerunning the core weave planner tests alongside the affected integration files now; if these hold, I can move to the repo-wide checks and the task-note sync.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2143_23

The recursive batch path is behaving now in both core and integration coverage. I’m syncing the documentation next so the task note stops claiming this is still an implementation gap, and I’ll record the batching approach before I run the full repo checks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2143_37

I’m updating the task note to reflect the actual new boundary rather than leaving stale “implementation gap” language in place. I’m also recording the batching decision explicitly, because the important part is not just that recursive `version` works now, but how it works and why it stays fail-closed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2144_34

The implementation and note sync are done. I’m on the full verification pass now: type-check, lint, and the full test suite, so we can close the loop on the task note with real repo-wide results rather than just the targeted cases.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2145_24

Verification is clean across the repo. I’m doing one last pass over the final diff and then I’ll give you the outcome, the touched areas, and a commit message that matches the actual implementation boundary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2145_43

Implemented the remaining `0820` gap: recursive multi-target `version` now batches against a staged virtual workspace state before any writes. The main logic is in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), where `prepareVersionExecution()` now reloads candidates from an in-memory overlay after each staged target and fails closed if a later target becomes invalid. In [src/core/weave/weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), the early mesh-inventory renderers now preserve existing mesh entries when the current inventory already materializes them, with legacy fallback for the minimal core planner fixtures.

Coverage was added in [tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts](../../tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts) and [tests/integration/weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and the core planner regressions are still covered in [src/core/weave/weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts). I also synced [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md), [wd.codebase-overview.md](wd.codebase-overview.md), and [wd.decision-log.md](wd.decision-log.md). I left your unrelated edits in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and [wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md](wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md) alone.

# User_2026-04-07_2306_23

"standalone CLI commands"? Is that validate, version and generate?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2306_35

Yes. In that note, “standalone CLI commands” means separate user-facing entry points for `validate`, `version`, and `generate`, instead of only exposing the composed `weave` flow.

Concretely, I mean something like:

```sh
weave validate --target ...
weave version --target ...
weave generate --target ...
```

not necessarily three separate binaries. The runtime seams already exist; what is still deferred is the user-facing CLI surface for them. If you want, I can tighten the note wording to “standalone CLI subcommands” or “separate user-facing CLI entry points” so it’s less ambiguous.

# User_2026-04-07_2307_14

that's fine. Just implement them.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2307_21

I’m implementing the separate CLI entry points now. First I’m reading the current `run.ts` command tree and the existing `weave` CLI tests so I can add `validate`, `version`, and `generate` without inventing a conflicting argument shape.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2307_25

I’ve confirmed the CLI only exposes the composed root `weave` flow right now. Next I’m wiring three subcommands onto the same target-parsing boundary so we reuse the existing request shapes instead of inventing a second CLI contract.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2307_36

I’m checking the existing target parser helpers before editing. If the subcommands can reuse the same parser and only differ in whether payload naming flags are allowed, the CLI will stay coherent instead of drifting by command.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2307_55

I need to check one CLI quirk before patching: whether the root command’s existing options are inherited by subcommands. If they are, `validate` and `generate` could accidentally accept version-only flags, which would be the wrong boundary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2308_34

I’ve got the command shape. I’m editing the runtime descriptions and CLI wiring now: `validate`/`generate` will use shared `--target`, `version` will additionally accept the payload naming flags, and bare `weave` will keep its current behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2310_03

I’m adding black-box CLI coverage now. The runtime seams are already tested; what I need here is proof that the new subcommands expose the right surface and preserve the existing boundaries, especially that `version` does not generate pages.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2310_20

The CLI and black-box tests are patched. I’m formatting and compiling next so I can catch any command-tree or helper drift before I touch the note/status docs.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2310_35

The code side is in good shape. I’m syncing the note and overview now so they stop saying the CLI entry points are deferred, then I’ll run the full repo verification pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2310_52

I’ve synced the docs to the new CLI boundary. Final step is the full repo pass again, because the command tree and black-box tests changed after the earlier green run.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2310_59

The compile and lint passes are clean. I’m just waiting on the full test suite now, mainly the new e2e CLI coverage, because that’s the only part this change can realistically break at this point.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2311_13

The new subcommands are passing black-box CLI coverage. I’m waiting on the tail of the integration suite, but the risk is basically burned down now because the command wiring already exercised the only new surface.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2311_45

Implemented `weave validate`, `weave version`, and `weave generate` in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts). They reuse the same target parsing boundary as bare `weave`; only `version` accepts `--payload-history-segment` and `--payload-state-segment`, while `validate` and `generate` stay on shared targeting only. I also added result summaries in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts) and black-box CLI coverage in [weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts).

I synced [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md), [wd.codebase-overview.md](wd.codebase-overview.md), and [wd.decision-log.md](wd.decision-log.md). I left the unrelated Kato conversation note [wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md](wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md) alone.

Verification passed: `deno task check`, `deno task lint`, and `deno task test`.

# User_2026-04-07_2315_38

greptile had feedback... for each item in @wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-greptile.md please add a checkbox and evaluate whether it's worth implementing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2315_44

I’m reviewing the Greptile feedback note first so I can turn each item into an actionable checklist entry instead of guessing at the intent. After that I’ll patch the note with per-item checkboxes and a short implement/not-implement judgment for each one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2316_36

I’m checking the review note against the repo guidance before editing it. Then I’ll patch each Greptile item into a checklist entry with a concrete implement / defer judgment.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2316_40

I’ve got the note contents. I’m checking the current code paths now so the worth-implementing judgments are grounded in the actual implementation, not just Greptile’s prose.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2317_07

I’ve got enough context. I’m patching the review note now so each Greptile point is a checklist item with an explicit disposition and rationale, without changing the underlying review content.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2317_19

The note is patched. I’m doing a quick read-back now to make sure the checklist formatting is clean and the dispositions match the current code rather than overcommitting to low-value cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2317_29

Updated [wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-greptile.md](wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-greptile.md) so each Greptile item is now a checklist entry with an explicit worth-implementing judgment.

My dispositions in the note are:

- `SharedTargetRequest` alias: probably not worth doing now
- specific per-field CLI error for trailing `=`: worth doing
- `recursive=false` handling: worth clarifying, but as help/docs behavior, not a runtime semantics change

No tests ran since this was a note-only edit.

# User_2026-04-07_2318_45

ok, just do the specific per-field CLI error

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2318_51

I’m changing the CLI target parser so a trailing `=` reports the field-specific error instead of the generic format error. I’ll update the parser and add a focused CLI test to pin the behavior down before I run the relevant checks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2319_08

I found the parser branch Greptile called out. I’m tightening only that condition and adding one black-box CLI test for `designatorPath=` so we don’t accidentally regress back to the generic message later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2319_12

I’m editing the parser and the e2e test now. I’m also marking that Greptile item done in the review note so the note reflects the code instead of drifting.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2319_31

The code path is updated and the review note is synced. I’m running the CLI e2e file that covers this parser surface, then lint, so we know the change didn’t introduce a formatting or static issue elsewhere.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2319_38

Lint is clean. The e2e run is still in flight, so I’m waiting on that before I close this out.

# User_2026-04-07_2319_39

What if we want to specify the legit "empty" designator path?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2319_47

I’m checking whether the core targeting model actually permits an empty designator path. If it does, the parser tweak I just made is too aggressive and we should change course before treating `designatorPath=` as a hard error.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2320_07

Right now, we can’t. An empty designator path is not a valid target anywhere in the current model.

The constraint is deeper than the CLI parser:

- [designator_segments.ts:8](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts#L8) rejects an empty `designatorPath` outright.
- [targeting.ts:146](../../src/core/targeting.ts#L146) always normalizes through that function.
- the current specs and commands treat `designatorPath` as required, not optional.

So `designatorPath=` is not a “legit empty path” today. It is just invalid input, and the parser returning `weave --target[0].designatorPath is required` is consistent with the rest of the codebase.

Also, `designatorPath=` is a bad encoding for root even if we later decide to support it, because it is indistinguishable from “user forgot the value.” If root designators become a real feature, we should give them an explicit representation instead of overloading an empty string.

The real question is: do we want root-designator support at all? If yes, that is a broader design task, not a parser tweak. It would need changes in targeting, path normalization, file layout assumptions, and likely a distinct CLI spelling.

# User_2026-04-07_2321_22

yes, we want root designator path. It's equivalent to <> in RDF.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2321_36

I’m checking where the code assumes non-empty designator paths so I can tell you whether “root designator path equals `<>`” is just a parser issue or a broader invariant breach. Then I’ll tell you the safest representation to use on the CLI.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2321_46

Root designator support is bigger than the CLI, and I found one hard blocker already: inventory discovery currently throws root away by design. I’m checking how IRIs and mesh-relative paths are built so I can tell you whether empty-string root is viable internally or whether it needs an explicit sentinel.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_08

If root designators are in scope, then `designatorPath=` is the wrong test case for the parser change. I’m switching the new coverage to a different field so we keep the better per-field error without baking in “empty designator path is invalid forever.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_14

I’ve de-risked the parser test. I’m running the focused CLI test file with the permissions it actually needs so I can give you a clean status instead of leaving it half-verified.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_17

Lint is still clean. The CLI tests are still running, so I’m waiting on that result before I close the loop on the root-designator implications.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_21

The failures were only permission-related in the test harness, not logic regressions. I’m rerunning the same CLI suite with `--allow-run` because the fixture loader shells out to `git`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_24

The CLI suite is progressing cleanly under the right permissions. I’m waiting for the rest of the run so I can give you a final status together with the root-designator implications.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2322_44

Yes. If the root identifier is semantically “the mesh base itself,” then internally it should be representable as the empty designator path, because that is the natural relative-path analogue of RDF `<>`.

But the CLI should not spell that as `designatorPath=`. That is too ambiguous with “missing value.” The safer contract is:

- internal representation: `designatorPath === ""`
- CLI representation: an explicit root sentinel, preferably `designatorPath=/`
- recursive root targeting: `designatorPath=/,recursive=true` means “everything”

That does require broader work, not just parser relaxation. Current code assumes non-empty paths in several places:
- [designator_segments.ts#L8](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts#L8)
- [inventory.ts#L55](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L55)
- [weave.ts#L4273](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L4273)

So root support needs root-aware path helpers, not raw string interpolation like ``${designatorPath}/_knop``. Otherwise you end up with bad paths like `/_knop` instead of `_knop`.

I also adjusted the new parser coverage so it no longer hardcodes “empty designator path is invalid forever”; it now checks `recursive=` instead. Verification passed with:
- `deno task lint`
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-run tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts`

If you want, I can write the task note for root designator path support next.

# User_2026-04-07_2324_19

just use "/" as root sentinel.

Please fill out wu.cli-reference with a concise but complete guide to CLI usage, and include the root special case

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2324_31

I’m reading the current CLI note and the implemented command surface first so I can replace it with an accurate reference instead of a wish-list. I’ll keep it concise, but I’m not going to document `/` as already working unless the code actually supports it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2324_34

The top-level weave commands are clear. I’m reading the rest of `run.ts` now so the reference includes the non-weave commands too, not just the newer validate/version/generate surface.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2324_51

I’ve got the full command surface. I’m replacing the empty note with a compact reference that covers the actual commands, targeting rules, examples, and the root sentinel as a planned special case rather than pretending it already works.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2325_11

The reference is written. I’m reading it back once to make sure it stays concise, doesn’t overpromise root support, and matches the actual CLI options and constraints.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2325_16

The reference covers most of the surface, but I left out `extract`, which makes it incomplete. I’m adding that plus a one-line note about `--help` so the doc closes the loop cleanly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_2325_22

Updated [wu.cli-reference.md](wu.cli-reference.md) into a concise user-facing CLI guide.

It now covers the actual command surface, shared `--target` syntax, payload naming constraints, common examples, and the root special case. I documented `/` as the intended root sentinel, but explicitly marked it as reserved rather than already implemented, because the current CLI still rejects root designator targeting.

No tests ran; this was a documentation-only change.

# User_2026-04-08_0700_13

commit mesg

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_0700_22

I’m checking the current worktree so the commit message matches the actual staged scope rather than just the last discussion topic.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_0700_38

Use this, assuming you do not include the Kato conversation note in the commit:

```text
feat(cli): improve target parse errors and document CLI usage

- return per-field errors for --target fields with missing values
- add e2e coverage for malformed target specs with empty field values
- add a concise user-facing CLI reference covering commands, targeting, and payload naming
- document the intended "/" root-designator sentinel as reserved future syntax
- record Greptile review follow-up and mark the CLI error improvement done
```

I would leave `documentation/notes/wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md` out of this commit unless you explicitly want conversation-log churn included.

# User_2026-04-08_0857_04

yes please

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_0857_22

I’m going to make the commit now using the message I suggested, and I’ll leave the Kato conversation note out of it so the commit stays scoped to the CLI/docs change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_0857_38

I didn’t create the commit.

Current worktree only has [wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md](wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1854-weave-targeting-codex.md) modified, and I’m not going to fold the Kato conversation note into the CLI/docs commit by default.

So one of these is true:

- the real CLI/docs changes were already committed
- they were reverted or moved out of the worktree

If you want, I can inspect the recent commit history and confirm whether the intended commit already landed.

# User_2026-04-08_1132_59

write the task note for root designator path support next.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1133_14

I’m drafting a dedicated task note for root designator path support. I’ll pull the current task-note template and the nearby weave notes first so the new note matches the repo’s tracking style and captures the real implementation blockers, not just the CLI surface.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1133_30

I’ve got the template and the nearby targeting note. I’m checking whether root designator support is mentioned anywhere else so the new task note can cross-link cleanly and avoid contradicting current docs.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1134_24

I’ve got the shape. I’m writing the note as a real implementation task, not a vague design stub, so it pins down `/` as the CLI sentinel, `""` as the internal root form, and the exact places where current path assumptions break.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1134_47

The note is in place. I’m doing one readback to make sure it pins down the `/` sentinel cleanly, keeps the internal empty-string representation explicit, and doesn’t accidentally broaden support-artifact targeting.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1135_02

Created [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-08_1133-root-designator-path-support.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-08_1133-root-designator-path-support.md).

It pins down the main contract:

- `/` is the CLI root sentinel
- `""` is the internal normalized root designator path
- root is the mesh-base resource, equivalent to RDF `<>`
- exact `/` targets only root, recursive `/` targets root plus descendants
- root-owned artifact paths must be `_knop`, `_history001`, `index.html`, not slash-prefixed variants

The note also scopes the real implementation work: root-aware path helpers, inventory discovery including `<_knop>`, shared `--target` support, single-designator CLI inputs, rendering `/` in user-facing displays, and the required core/runtime/integration/e2e coverage.

No tests ran; this was a note-only change.

# User_2026-04-08_1135_02

what would be the actual deno command to execute weave cli?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1135_15

I’m checking the entrypoint and tasks so I can give you the exact invocation the repo actually expects, not just the raw test harness command.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1135_35

From the repo root, the raw command is:

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env src/main.ts
```

That is the CLI entrypoint in [src/main.ts](../../src/main.ts), and it matches the `dev:root` task in [deno.json](../../deno.json).

Examples:

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env src/main.ts --help
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env src/main.ts validate --target 'designatorPath=alice/bio'
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env src/main.ts version --target 'designatorPath=alice/bio'
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env src/main.ts generate --target 'designatorPath=alice,recursive=true'
```

Equivalent convenience task:

```sh
deno task dev:root
```

# User_2026-04-09_0001_59

Please continue with the latest review comments appended.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0002_09

I’m reading the appended targeting review comments and checking the current worktree so I can tell which ones are already addressed, which are real, and which need code changes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0002_28

I’ve got the review note. I’m checking the newest unresolved findings in code now so I can separate real regressions from stale review noise before I change anything.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0002_37

The code has already moved quite a bit past some of the older comments. I’m checking the remaining Entelligence/Coderabbit items now, especially the ones that look like they could still be real regressions rather than already-stale review output.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0003_19

Most of the newest code comments are stale against the current branch. The one real repo-policy issue is the manual `updated` frontmatter in the review note itself, and I’m syncing that note now while preserving the appended review content.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0003_38

Updated [wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md](wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md) to remove the manual `updated` frontmatter and marked that latest Coderabbit item done.

The rest of the newest appended comments look stale against current code, so I did not force code changes for them:
- the `planFirstKnopWeave` arity complaint no longer matches the current call site
- the `toSharedTargetRequest` complaint conflicts with the current intended `weave` contract, where `WeaveRequest` may still carry version-oriented fields programmatically while shared CLI `--target` remains restricted
- the `Map.get(...)/undefined` target-selection complaint is not a real bug in the current flow because resolved targeted selections always carry a concrete target when targets were supplied

No tests ran because this was a review-note-only update. If you want, I can keep going through the older unresolved `[c]` items and prune or confirm those next.

# User_2026-04-09_0027_40

Please update [wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md](wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md)  to include checkboxes [ ] with [c] for all the items cancelled already or of the new ones not worth doing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0027_55

I’m normalizing the review note status markers now. First I’ll scan the whole file so I only change the unresolved items that should clearly be marked `[c]` rather than guessing from the visible excerpt.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0027_58

There are still several appended items at the end without status markers. I’m reading the tail of the note now and then I’ll convert the ones we’ve already effectively cancelled into explicit `[c]` entries.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0028_11

I’ve reached the unmarked tail items. I’m spot-checking the code paths they mention before I cancel them, so the note records real decisions instead of hand-waving them away.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0028_25

A couple of the remaining appended findings are still plausible, so I’m checking the specific invariants they rely on before I decide which ones should get `[c]` and which ones should stay open.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0028_51

I’ve identified the obvious no-action duplicates and stale findings. I’m checking whether the note has any more unmarked tail items beyond this block before I rewrite their markers.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0029_26

I’m normalizing the remaining unmarked bullets now: clear duplicates/stale findings get `[c]`, the already-fixed note-format nit gets `[x]`, and the one extract-root duplicate-triples item that still looks actionable stays open as `[ ]`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0029_51

The note moved a bit under me, so I’m patching the remaining bullets in smaller chunks rather than forcing a brittle bulk edit.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0030_24

The remaining tail items are marked. I’m reading the updated section back once to confirm the statuses are exactly what you asked for: stale/duplicate/no-action items as `[c]`, already-fixed note cleanup as `[x]`, and the one still-actionable extract issue left open as `[ ]`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0030_31

I’ve got the statuses where you asked. I’m doing one quick structural scan for any remaining plain `- ` bullets in that note so I don’t leave stray unmarked review items behind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-09_0030_37

Updated [wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md](wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review.md) so the remaining appended items now all have status checkboxes.

I marked:
- stale/duplicate/not-worth-doing items as `[c]`
- the already-fixed note-format nit as `[x]`
- the extract root-duplicate-triples item as `[ ]` since that one still looks actionable

No tests ran; this was a review-note-only edit.
