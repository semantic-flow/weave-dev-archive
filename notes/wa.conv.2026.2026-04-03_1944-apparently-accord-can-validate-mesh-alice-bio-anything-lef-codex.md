# User_2026-04-03_1749_01

Apparently accord can validate mesh-alice-bio. Anything left on accord development? Or can we start using it to build the Semantic Flow APIweave? See [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]] for a summary of learnings from the mesh-alice-bio process. 

Accord was a successful test of Semantic Web libraries with Deno. Seems like we can just use Deno for weave. Not that we have to. 

But it seems like the next step is to pick up the SF API, see [[sf.api]], and perhaps the to sf.conv.* conversations for context.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1749_10

Reviewing the repository guidance and the linked spec first, then I’ll trace the current Accord and SF API notes to see whether Accord still has blocking development work or is already good enough to serve as the validation substrate for Weave.

The current spec is fairly clear on one point: `weave` is now an orchestration boundary over `version`, `validate`, and `generate`, not the place where semantic edits happen. I’m checking whether Accord already covers the hard part of that boundary, or whether it still needs its own roadmap before Weave can safely build on it.

I haven’t seen Accord-specific status notes yet, so I’m switching from the API docs to the repository inventory itself: where Accord lives, what its tests/manifests cover, and whether any open task notes still describe it as experimental rather than reusable.

Accord does not appear to be vendored into this repo, which is already a useful signal: Weave can treat it as an external proving ground rather than something that must be completed in-tree first. I’m looking at the finished `mesh-alice-bio` note and the surrounding repos now to see whether there are still unresolved capability gaps.

The `mesh-alice-bio` task note reads as finished, not awaiting more Accord work. The remaining question is whether Accord itself has any open gaps outside this repo, so I’m locating the sibling project and checking its current state directly.

I’m not finding a sibling `accord` checkout locally. That probably means any “Accord status” we infer has to come from the manifests and conversation notes rather than inspecting its source directly, so I’m mining those notes next.

The framework already has the full conformance ladder from `01` through `13`, which is stronger evidence than a hand-wavy “Accord seems promising.” I’m checking the conformance README and a few SF conversation notes now to see what they imply about the next implementation boundary.

The conformance README is explicit: the manifests are already intended as the normative acceptance layer, just ahead of a dedicated runner. That’s a strong sign the next missing piece is not “more Accord design,” but wiring those manifests into Weave’s execution and validation story.

The framework notes are lining up around the same conclusion: Accord is already doing its job as the acceptance-spec layer, and the unresolved work sits on the Weave side. I’m checking the current Weave codebase notes now so I can answer in terms of what should actually be built next, not just in terms of framework documents.

There’s effectively no live implementation in this repo yet: no `deno.json`, no source tree, and even the codebase-overview note is empty. That makes the next-step recommendation cleaner, because there isn’t any existing runtime architecture here that Deno would have to displace.

The older planning note asked whether Deno needed a proof of concept before committing. At this point that proof appears to have happened in practice: the framework notes record Accord as the successful Deno-based validation layer. What’s missing is the first Weave implementation task, not another abstract runtime viability study.

One last check: whether there is already any runner or executor code hiding in the framework repo. If there isn’t, that clarifies the split cleanly: Accord is the spec/validation substrate, while Weave still needs the actual manifest-driven execution and comparison harness.

There’s no runner code in the framework repo; the manifests are the artifact, not the executable yet. That matters because it means Weave still needs two things on its side: the actual operation implementation, and a small manifest-driven comparison harness to prove the implementation matches the fixture ladder.

The strongest concrete Deno evidence is in the Accord work itself: `n3` and `@comunica/query-sparql` were already spiked successfully under Deno, and the remaining hard part was canonical RDF comparison rather than basic library viability. I’m reading the actual Accord task note now so I can separate “still open” from “nice-to-have.”

The Accord repo is present locally under `dependencies/github.com/spectacular-voyage/accord`; I just missed the note path on the first read. I’m locating that exact task note now rather than relying on the conversation summary.

The Accord README matches the rest of the evidence: runner-neutral acceptance layer, small deterministic `accord check`, and separate SHACL validation. I’m reading the finished Accord CLI/spec notes now to see whether the remaining Accord work is merely productization, or whether anything there would still block Weave.

I’ve got enough from the notes to answer, but I’m doing one concrete sanity check on Accord itself: whether the repo actually contains the Deno CLI and source layout the completed note claims, so the recommendation rests on code as well as docs.

I’ve confirmed the code is there. I’m running the Accord test suite now, including the `mesh-alice-bio` smoke check, so the recommendation is based on current execution state rather than only completed notes.

The tests started cleanly. I’m waiting for the full results now; if anything fails, that changes the recommendation materially.

The `mesh-alice-bio` smoke suite is green. I’m letting the broader Accord suite finish, but the specific proof point you care about is already holding.

The smoke suite is green already, but I want one stronger answer to your exact question: whether Accord validates the whole current `mesh-alice-bio` ladder, not just a representative subset. I’m checking how the CLI is invoked and then I’ll run it across the full manifest set.

The full-corpus run is in progress. If this stays green through `13-bob-extracted-woven`, then the answer becomes straightforward: start Weave, and treat Accord as the acceptance harness rather than another project that needs proving out first.

As of April 3, 2026: yes, start using Accord to build Weave’s implementation of the Semantic Flow API.

I verified the current Accord repo directly. `deno task test` passed `69` tests, `deno task test:mesh-alice-bio` passed, and a full run of all `13` Alice Bio conformance manifests against `mesh-alice-bio` passed. That lines up with the completed notes in [[ac.completed.2026.2026-04-03-accord-cli]] and [[sf.completed.2026.2026-03-29-conformance-for-mesh-alice-bio]].

What’s left on Accord is mostly non-blocking polish:
- keep the full-corpus rerun automated
- maybe add a separate `accord validate` SHACL command
- maybe publish a shared JSON-LD context
- maybe tighten non-RDF compare modes later

The pushback is this: Accord being ready does not mean Weave validation is “done.” Accord is your acceptance harness. Weave still needs its own runtime behavior for `mesh create`, `knop create`, `integrate`, `knop.addReference`, `extract`, and `weave` as the `version + validate + generate` boundary described in [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]].

On runtime choice, I would stop reopening the question and use Deno for Weave unless a concrete blocker appears. That matches [[wd.general-guidance]], and Accord already proved the relevant Deno RDF stack is viable.

The next step I’d recommend is not “build the whole HTTP API first.” It’s this:

1. Write a new `wd.task.*` note for Weave bootstrap.
2. Scaffold a Deno-first local/in-process Weave core.
3. Implement the first ladder slice against Accord: `mesh create` then `weave`, then `knop create` then `weave`.
4. Use Accord in CI as the acceptance oracle from day one.
5. Add the daemon/OpenAPI/Hydra job layer after the local core is replaying fixture transitions cleanly, following [[sf.api]] and [[sf.api.architecture]].

If you want, I can turn that into the first concrete Weave bootstrap task note and scaffold the Deno project in this repo.

# User_2026-04-03_1756_21

Just as a reminder, weave is perhaps-too-confusingly a CLI, an implementation of the public OpenAPI-based Semantic Flow API, and there's a web app in the mix that now that I'm thinking about it, should probably have a different name. (For kato I did "kato" as the command and the general binary packaging that included kato-web and kato-daemon.) 

Do you still think "weave bootstrap first, API specification later"?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1756_39

No, not in that blunt form.

With your clarification, I’d change the recommendation to: bootstrap the **semantic core and Weave implementation first**, while continuing a **thin public API spec in parallel**. I would not defer the API spec until after implementation, and I also would not try to finish a detailed OpenAPI before the implementation exists.

The boundary in [[sf.api.architecture]] is still the right one: the Semantic Flow API is the public contract, and Weave is one implementation. So the practical sequence I’d use is:

1. Keep the framework repo as the home of the public contract.
2. Specify only the stable thin layer now:
   `Job`, core resources, operation submission shape, status/result model, Hydra affordances, and the first operation set from [[sf.api]].
3. Bootstrap Weave’s local/in-process core against the fixture ladder and Accord.
4. Put the daemon HTTP layer on top of that same core.
5. Treat the CLI and web app as clients of the implementation, not as the place where semantics live.

So:
- `API spec later` for exhaustive HTTP details: yes.
- `API spec later` for the public contract itself: no.

Your naming clarification actually strengthens that view, because there are now at least three things to keep separate:
- Semantic Flow API: public contract
- Weave: implementation/product family
- CLI / daemon / web app: packaged clients and runtimes

I also agree the web app probably wants a different name. Reusing `weave` for command, daemon family, implementation, and browser UI is too much semantic load.

If you want, I can draft a short naming/boundary note and a concrete first-pass OpenAPI skeleton scope so the bootstrap work doesn’t drift.

# User_2026-04-03_1806_20

Can/should we have the CLI capable of operating independently of the API http implementation? Isn't the daemon just the implementation of http API?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1806_27

I’m checking the framework notes that already discuss offline CLI and daemon/API boundaries, then I’ll answer directly instead of re-litigating the whole architecture.

Yes, the CLI should be able to operate without the HTTP API implementation.

But the cleaner framing is:

- the **Semantic Flow API** is the public contract
- the **daemon** is one long-running service implementation of that contract over HTTP
- the **CLI** should support both:
  - remote mode against the daemon
  - local/in-process mode against shared logic

That is already the direction recorded in [[sf.api.architecture|sf.api.architecture.md#L48]] and [[sf.api.architecture|sf.api.architecture.md#L53]].

So the answer to “isn’t the daemon just the implementation of the HTTP API?” is: mostly yes, but that undersells it. The daemon is not just an HTTP wrapper. It is the service runtime that owns things like job execution, locking, watches, queueing, and progress/event emission. HTTP is one interface it exposes. The actual semantic operations should live below that, in shared core code.

The architecture I’d aim for is:

- shared semantic core
- daemon = HTTP/API host over that core
- CLI remote mode = client of daemon
- CLI local mode = direct caller of the same core

What you do not want is:
- CLI forced to go through HTTP for local work
- or CLI reimplementing semantics separately from the daemon

So: independent execution mode, yes. Independent implementation of semantics, no. That also fits [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning|wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning.md#L78]] and the job-oriented operation model in [[sf.api|sf.api.md#L24]].

If you want, I can sketch the package boundary next: `core` vs `daemon` vs `cli` vs web app.

# User_2026-04-03_1807_56

Sure, sketch away.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1808_38

I’d sketch it like this:

```text
semantic-flow-framework/
  public Semantic Flow API contract
  OpenAPI, Hydra conventions, examples, operation/resource vocabulary

weave/
  shared semantic implementation
  local and daemon execution surfaces
```

Inside Weave, the boundary should be:

```text
core
  semantic operations and domain rules
  mesh create, knop create, integrate, version, validate, generate, extract, weave
  request/result types shared by all callers

runtime
  local workspace execution
  filesystem, git, RDF loading, page generation, config, locking hooks
  job execution primitives, but not HTTP

daemon
  HTTP implementation of the public API
  Job resources, queueing, SSE, durable status, auth later
  translates HTTP <-> core/runtime calls

cli
  terminal UX only
  remote mode: talks to daemon over HTTP
  local mode: calls core/runtime directly
  no separate semantic logic

web app
  browser client of daemon
  should probably not be named “weave”
  no semantic logic here either
```

The key rule is: one semantic implementation, multiple adapters. That matches [[sf.api.architecture|sf.api.architecture.md#L9]], [[sf.api.architecture|sf.api.architecture.md#L48]], and [[sf.api|sf.api.md#L10]].

A few pushy opinions:

- Do not put HTTP concepts in `core`.
- Do not put CLI argument semantics in `core`.
- Do not make the daemon the only way to run operations locally.
- Do not let the CLI reimplement behavior separately from the daemon.
- Do not over-package too early.

So for the first pass, I would not start with six workspace packages. I’d start with one Deno codebase under `src/` using directory boundaries:

```text
src/core/
src/runtime/
src/daemon/
src/cli/
```

Then split into packages only when the seams prove real.

If you want, I can turn this into a concrete proposed repo layout and first bootstrap task note.

# User_2026-04-03_1810_21

Accord is at weave/dependencies/github.com/spectacular-voyage/accord

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1810_27

That is the Accord repo I ended up using.

I missed it on the first pass because I searched too shallowly under `hub`, but the live repo is indeed at [accord](../../dependencies/github.com/spectacular-voyage/accord). That’s the checkout where I verified the current state: `deno task test` passed, `deno task test:mesh-alice-bio` passed, and the full Alice Bio manifest ladder checked cleanly there.

So the recommendation stands, but now with the exact local path pinned.

# User_2026-04-03_1817_43

I put your boundaries into the corresponding README.md files. 

interesting that you separate runtime from core.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1817_50

I’m reading the updated README boundaries first so I can respond against what you actually wrote, then I’ll explain why I split `runtime` from `core` and where that seam is worth protecting.

Yes. The reason I separate `runtime` from `core` is not abstraction worship. It is to keep “what the operation means” separate from “how this host executes it.”

`core` should answer things like:
- what `weave` does
- what `mesh create` or `integrate` is allowed to change
- what invariants must hold after success
- what request/result shapes look like

`runtime` should answer things like:
- how to read and write the workspace
- how to resolve git refs
- how RDF is loaded and queried
- how pages are rendered to files
- how locks, config, temp paths, and job workers behave

So the seam is basically:
- `core` = semantic rules and operation model
- `runtime` = host capabilities and side effects

That split buys you a few real things:
- CLI local mode can call the same semantics without going through HTTP
- daemon does not become the only place where operations are “real”
- tests can hit semantic logic without always materializing a full daemon/workspace stack
- later, if you ever want a different execution host, you are not forced to untangle HTTP and filesystem assumptions from the domain model

That said, I would not over-formalize it yet. Some code will blur the line at first, especially around RDF handling and page generation. Fine. I’d treat it as a design boundary first, not a rigid package ceremony.

One pushback: [README.md](../../README.md) is now carrying package-layout detail, which conflicts with your repo guidance that the root README stay user-facing and light on development specifics. I’d move the package boundary material into [[wd.codebase-overview]] and keep the root README simpler.

# User_2026-04-03_1829_29

Good pushback, done.

 So we have the two wd tasks [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]] and [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]] 

Should we update those and make some decisions? I'd like to consider reusing the logging at least.

I'm imagining the CLI will have an "interactive" mode, to walk people through the many options they'll have for creating knops and meshes and providing provenance and referencelinkage. Does that push us towards an interactive CLI library like inquirer, cliffy, prompts, enquirer, or even (perhaps in addition) a TUI framework like Ink, Pastel, or Melker (https://github.com/wistrand/melker/)

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1829_43

I’m reviewing the two existing Weave task notes plus the old logging shape locally, then I’ll check the current state of the CLI/TUI libraries you named before recommending a direction.

I’ve got the old task notes in view. Next I’m checking the existing `sflo` logging package shape locally and the current status of the interactive CLI/TUI libraries you named, because the Deno-first constraint changes that recommendation a lot.

I have enough to call it. The old logging package is useful conceptually, but it is visibly Node-shaped. I’m checking its package metadata once so I can be precise about what I’d reuse versus what I’d leave behind.

Yes, I would update both task notes now and turn several “open decisions” into actual decisions.

Those notes are stale in a few important ways:

- Deno RDF viability is no longer hypothetical; Accord proved it.
- daemon/API/CLI boundary is no longer fuzzy; [[sf.api.architecture]] already says CLI supports both remote and local/in-process modes.
- the repo-shape note still assumes an `apps/` + `packages/` split as the default first move, while your newer boundary sketch in [[wd.codebase-overview]] is flatter and better.

What I would do:

1. Update [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]]
   - keep `dependencies/`
   - replace “likely `apps/` + `packages/` immediately” with “start flatter under `src/core`, `src/runtime`, `src/daemon`, `src/cli`, later split if needed”
   - note that the public contract currently lives in `semantic-flow-framework`, not a day-one separate spec repo

2. Update [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]]
   - close Deno viability as decided
   - close daemon/API naming as decided
   - close CLI offline/local mode as decided
   - close OpenAPI-primary plus optional AsyncAPI companion as decided
   - narrow “package boundaries” to one real next decision: logging reuse shape

3. Add 3-5 short entries to [[wd.decision-log]]
   - `dependencies/` stays
   - Deno-first runtime is accepted
   - daemon implements the HTTP API, but shared core/runtime stay below it
   - CLI supports remote and local/in-process execution
   - OpenAPI primary, Jobs canonical, SSE likely, AsyncAPI companion only if needed

On logging: yes, reuse it, but not by lifting the old package whole.

The old `@semantic-flow/logging` package is explicitly Node-targeted, uses `node:async_hooks`, `node:os`, `node:process`, and even declares `"node": ">=24.0"` in its package metadata. So my recommendation is:

- reuse the model
  - log levels
  - structured context
  - component/operation child loggers
  - CLI vs service presets
  - timers/checkpoints
- do not reuse the implementation wholesale
  - singleton-heavy setup
  - Node-specific context plumbing
  - file/monitoring channel ambitions
  - old error-type sprawl

For Weave v1 I would create one small Deno-native logging module:
- console-only first
- structured context
- child/component loggers
- operation/job/request ids
- no file channel yet
- no observability package yet

So on the old “logging vs observability” question: logging now, observability later.

On the interactive CLI question: no, this does not push you to Ink/Pastel/Melker yet.

An “interactive” CLI for Weave sounds like:
- guided prompts
- validation
- conditional follow-up questions
- confirmation/review step
- maybe a diff/preview before apply

That is still a prompt-driven CLI, not a TUI.

My recommendation:

- use a prompt library for `--interactive`
- keep TUI as a separate future decision
- do not pull React into the main CLI path

Given your Deno-first constraint, I would rank the options like this:

1. `Cliffy`
   - best fit for Weave right now
   - Deno-native history, now runtime-agnostic
   - gives you command parsing and prompts in one family
   - current packages are on JSR and support Deno/Node/Bun  
   Sources: [Cliffy JSR](https://jsr.io/@cliffy/prompt), [Cliffy repo](https://github.com/c4spar/cliffy)

2. `@deno-cli-tools/prompts`
   - good lightweight fallback if you want a smaller prompt-only dependency
   - Deno-focused, simple API, fewer moving parts  
   Source: [JSR](https://jsr.io/@deno-cli-tools/prompts)

3. `Melker` later, only if you decide you want a real TUI app
   - interesting, Deno-first, more “terminal app framework” than “wizard prompts”
   - better for a future TUI/browser-adjacent product than for the main CLI  
   Source: [Melker repo](https://github.com/wistrand/melker)

I would avoid for first-pass Weave CLI:

- `Inquirer`
  - solid, active, but Node-centered and stream/raw-mode oriented
  - not aligned with your Deno-first posture  
  Source: [Inquirer repo](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)

- `Enquirer`
  - also Node-centered, older posture, no Deno advantage  
  Source: [Enquirer repo](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer)

- `Ink` / `Pastel`
  - these are React/Node terminal UI frameworks
  - they make sense only if you want a genuinely componentized terminal app, not just interactive commands  
  Sources: [Ink repo](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), [Pastel repo](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/pastel)

So my concrete advice is:

- update the two task notes now
- decide to port logging concepts, not the old Node package
- choose `Cliffy` for the first interactive CLI
- defer any TUI framework until you can say “we need a persistent multi-pane terminal app,” not just “we need prompts”

If you want, I can turn that into a proposed decision list and a patch plan for those two `wd.task.*` notes before we edit anything.

# User_2026-04-03_1848_32

Sorry, I was talking about the kato logging. see spectacular-voyage/kato

Great, Cliffy it is. 

Update the notes please.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1848_42

I’m checking the Kato logging shape and the current Weave notes now, then I’ll patch the task notes and the decision log so the stale open questions become actual decisions.

I found the Kato side. The useful thing to carry over is not “full observability stack now,” but its in-repo logger facade and the split between operational and audit logging, with a later adapter seam for more advanced plumbing. I’m reading those Kato observability files once so the note updates are concrete rather than vague.

I’m patching the Weave notes now. The main changes are: flatten the initial repo layout, close the Deno/daemon/API decisions, record the Kato logging carry-forward, and lock `Cliffy` as the first interactive CLI library.

The note patches are in. I’m reading them back once to catch wording drift and make sure the decisions landed cleanly, especially the Kato logging carry-forward and the monorepo layout rewrite.

There were two small inconsistencies left: the architecture note still listed `dependencies/` vs `references/` as open, and the monorepo note still said “shared packages” in one spot even though the layout is now flatter. I’m fixing those now.

The inconsistencies are cleaned up. I’m doing one last quick status check, then I’ll summarize exactly what changed and what the new live decisions are.

Updated the Weave notes to lock the decisions we just made.

The main changes are in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]] and [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]]: they now treat Deno-first as settled, keep the public contract in `semantic-flow-framework` for now, flatten the initial Weave layout under `src/`, lock `dependencies/`, record the daemon/core/runtime/CLI boundary, and carry forward Kato logging concepts rather than old sflo logging. I also recorded the resulting decisions in [[wd.decision-log]].

I updated [[wd.codebase-overview]] and [[wd.cli]] too, so they now explicitly say the first-pass CLI uses Cliffy and that runtime owns the first Deno-native operational/audit logging layer.

No tests ran, since this was docs-only. I did not touch the existing untracked [`.kato-workspace-config.yaml`](.kato-workspace-config.yaml).

# User_2026-04-03_1851_52

For Accord we used the term "black box functional testing"... would those be considered integration tests?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1852_00

Not necessarily.

“Black-box functional testing” and “integration testing” overlap, but they are not the same thing.

For Accord, the black-box tests are black-box because they exercise the CLI through its public behavior:
- manifest in
- fixture repo in
- pass/fail/report out

That says nothing by itself about scope. A black-box test can be:
- unit-ish, if it hits a very small self-contained surface
- integration, if it crosses real subsystems like CLI parsing, git access, RDF parsing, canonicalization, and SPARQL
- end-to-end-ish, if it also uses a real external repo/worktree/corpus and near-production invocation

In Accord’s case, I would describe them as mostly **integration-style black-box functional tests**. The `mesh-alice-bio` smoke tests are clearly integration tests, because they exercise multiple subsystems together against real manifests and a real fixture repo. They are not just unit tests with a CLI wrapper.

So the clean phrasing is:
- `black-box functional` describes the testing style
- `integration` describes the scope

If you want a repo taxonomy, I’d use:
- `unit`: parser, compare-mode, git-helper, report-shape pieces
- `integration`: `accord check` against synthetic fixture repos and the Alice Bio smoke corpus
- `e2e`: probably reserved for something even closer to packaged-user execution, if you ever need that distinction

So yes, many of the Accord black-box functional tests are integration tests, but “black-box functional” is not automatically synonymous with “integration.”

# User_2026-04-03_1853_24

is the proposed "tests" hierarchy for weave adequate? where do non-integration functional tests go? unit tests?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1853_40

Not quite. The current proposed hierarchy is a little too thin.

`tests/e2e`, `tests/integration`, `tests/fixtures` is fine as a start, but it leaves two gaps:

- where narrow unit tests live
- where shared harness/support code lives

I would not create a top-level `functional/` bucket yet. “Functional” describes test style, not scope, and it turns into a junk drawer fast.

My recommendation:

```text
src/
  ...
  foo_test.ts              # unit tests close to code when practical

tests/
  integration/             # cross-subsystem tests
  e2e/                     # packaged/user-path tests
  support/                 # harnesses, helpers, fakes, temp-repo builders
  fixtures/                # reusable fixture trees/repos/manifests
```

And the rule should be:

- `unit`
  - single module or very small cluster
  - no real daemon
  - no real HTTP
  - no real multi-subsystem workspace flow
  - these can live beside the code in `src/**`

- `integration`
  - real interaction between subsystems
  - examples: CLI command routing + core/runtime + git/RDF/page generation
  - many black-box functional tests will land here

- `e2e`
  - closest to real user execution
  - packaged CLI invocation, daemon process, HTTP boundary, maybe browser later

So for your specific question: non-integration functional tests do not automatically become integration tests. If they are functional in style but narrow in scope, yes, they should usually be treated as unit tests. If they cross real subsystem boundaries, they belong in integration.

If you want one extra middle bucket, `component/` is the only one I’d consider. But I would start without it.

Can you fill out [[wd.testing]] . I want to try to do TDD where possible. 

Accord has one "spec" that we defined to help generate the bb tests for TDD. Specs can go in documentation/notes to, e.g. wd.spec.*. Maybe we add something about that to [[wd.general-guidance]]

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1856_13

I’m reading the current testing and general-guidance notes first, then I’ll patch them with a concrete TDD/testing policy and the role of `wd.spec.*` notes in driving black-box or integration tests.

I’ve got the shape. I’m patching `wd.testing` with a concrete TDD/testing strategy and then tightening `wd.general-guidance` so `wd.task.*` and `wd.spec.*` are treated explicitly and consistently.

The patches are in. I’m reading them back now to make sure the testing scope, TDD guidance, and `wd.spec.*` role all landed cleanly and without turning the notes into mush.

Filled out [[wd.testing]] with a concrete testing posture:

- prefer TDD where practical
- separate `unit`, `integration`, and `e2e` by scope
- put unit tests near code, with `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/support`, and `tests/fixtures` for broader scopes
- use `wd.spec.*` notes to drive higher-level black-box or integration tests when behavior is cross-cutting or externally visible
- treat Accord-style acceptance checks as complementary to, not a replacement for, unit and integration tests

I also updated [[wd.general-guidance]] to:

- fix `wd.tasks.*` to `wd.task.*`
- add explicit guidance for `wd.spec.*` behavior notes
- state that spec notes can feed integration tests, black-box functional tests, and Accord manifests
- remind contributors to update relevant specs and tests together when behavior changes

No tests ran, since this was docs-only. I did not touch the existing untracked [`.kato-workspace-config.yaml`](.kato-workspace-config.yaml).

OK, for remaining open questions. 

- public API, I'm fine with your suggestion of starting thin and co-developing. 
- mesh create seems a good first slice
- I'd imagined "integrate" as "give a DigitalArtifact an IRI (and a meta and inventory and possibly a config and a reference catalog)" - so yes, large-scale integrate and large-scale version are probably jobs. We'd talked about making everything a job, but maybe that's not right.
- weave user docs stay under documentation/notes, under wu.* I think. stuff that's common to users and developers can live a the top level for now: e.g. [[product-vision]], [[roadmap]] 
- Why not just use all of the Kato (which is Deno-native) logging?
- your "runtime" stuff seems fine, although renderers is likely going to be huge, basically a static site generator with template support. I do want to note that all config should be via RDF, probably in jsonld. I want to be able to query config via SPARQL.
- can you suggest a great name for the web client?
- let's defer TUI

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1918_12

I’d lock these.

- `Public API`: start thin and co-develop with implementation. Keep the contract lean at first: core resources, `Job`, first operation slice, status/result model, Hydra affordances.
- `First slice`: `mesh create` is the right first slice. It is foundational, concrete, and gives you a clean first non-woven vs woven story.
- `Jobs`: I would still keep the public mutation contract job-centric. Not every HTTP interaction is a job, but every submitted semantic operation probably should be. Cheap operations can just return an already-terminal `Job` quickly. That keeps the contract uniform without forcing everything to be slow or queued.
- `Integrate`: your phrasing is good. If `integrate` means assigning a `DigitalArtifact` an IRI and creating its support surfaces, then large-scale `integrate` and large-scale `version` are definitely job candidates.
- `Docs`: agreed. User docs under `wu.*`, developer docs under `wd.*`, and shared cross-audience notes like [[product-vision]] and [[roadmap]] can stay top-level.
- `Kato logging`: I would not reject full reuse. My pushback is only against dragging in all of Kato observability by default. If the Kato logging code is already isolated enough, I’d reuse most of it:
  - `StructuredLogger`
  - `AuditLogger`
  - JSONL sinks
  - level config
  - noop/test sink
  - adapter seam
  But I would still defer the full OpenTelemetry/observability ambition until Weave has real runtime pressure for it.
- `Runtime`: agreed on renderers being huge. That strengthens the case for `runtime` as a boundary, not weakens it. I’d keep rendering under `runtime` initially, then split it later if it grows into its own subsystem.
- `Config`: I agree with the direction that canonical persisted config should be RDF, probably JSON-LD, and queryable via SPARQL. My only caution is: don’t force every transient CLI flag to become an RDF file. Persistent config and resolved config model: yes. Every ephemeral invocation detail: not necessarily.
- `Web client name`: my top suggestion is `Shuttle`.
  - It stays in the weaving family.
  - It is clearly not the daemon or the CLI.
  - “Shuttle for Weave” sounds like a client, not the platform itself.
  Other decent options: `Lattice`, `Selvedge`, `Spindle`.
- `TUI`: defer it.

The only place I’d push back a bit is the jobs point: I think “everything submitted is a Job” is still the cleanest public API model, as long as “job” does not imply “always backgrounded.”

If you want, I can patch the notes again to lock these remaining decisions too.

# User_2026-04-03_1924_37

shuttle is fine for the web client. OK, patch the notes to lock these decisions, then propose next steps. Should we craft an "implementation checklist" for [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]]? Or is it basically no-op ?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1924_41

I’m patching the remaining open decisions into the notes now: thin co-developed API, `mesh create` as the first slice, job-centric submitted operations, RDF/JSON-LD config direction, user-doc placement, `Shuttle` for the web client, and TUI deferred. After that I’ll give you a concrete read on whether the monorepo task needs an implementation checklist or should just be treated as effectively settled.

The remaining decisions are patched. I’m doing a quick readback to make sure the monorepo note is now clearly “mostly settled” and that the architecture note points toward a concrete next task rather than staying abstract.

Patched the notes to lock the remaining decisions.

What changed:
- [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]] now records:
  - thin co-developed public API
  - `mesh create` as the first carried slice
  - job-centric submitted semantic operations
  - RDF/JSON-LD persistent config, queryable via SPARQL
  - substantial reuse of Kato’s Deno-native logging if the extraction stays narrow
  - `Shuttle` as the web client name
  - TUI deferred
- [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]] now makes clearer that it is basically a settled decision note, not the place for a growing implementation backlog.
- [[wd.codebase-overview]] now reflects `Shuttle` and the RDF config direction.
- [[wd.decision-log]] now records the new locked decisions explicitly.

On your question: no, I would not turn [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-15-fresh-monorepo]] into an implementation checklist. It is basically a no-op now in the good sense: its job was to freeze repo-shape and boundary decisions, and it has done that. If you add an implementation checklist there, it will start mixing topology decisions with actual build work and become muddy.

The next step should be a new task note, something like:
- `wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create.md`

That note should own the real implementation checklist. I’d put in it:

1. Scaffold the first Deno project shape under `src/core`, `src/runtime`, `src/daemon`, `src/cli`, `src/web`.
2. Extract or port the first-pass Kato logging layer into Weave runtime.
3. Define request/result types for `mesh create`.
4. Write or refine a `wd.spec.*` note for `mesh create` behavior if needed.
5. Add failing tests:
   - unit tests for narrow core pieces
   - integration tests for local `mesh create`
   - a black-box/integration acceptance path tied to fixture expectations
6. Implement local/in-process `mesh create`.
7. Add the first thin HTTP-facing API example for the same slice.
8. Update codebase overview and decision log as needed.

If you want, I can draft that bootstrap task note next and make it concrete instead of just naming it.

# User_2026-04-03_1927_56

Do we have to move any decision out of the task or can it be moved to wd.completed? 

Go ahead and write the bootstrap task. Maybe move some of the unchecked todo items from [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]] so we can complete that too.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1928_05

I’m treating the architecture-planning note as ready to close once its remaining actionable items are either completed or explicitly moved into a new bootstrap task. I’ll draft the new `mesh create` bootstrap task note from the task template, then I’ll update the planning note so it stops pretending to own implementation work.

I’ve got the task template and current notes in view. I’m generating the new bootstrap task note now and then I’ll collapse the remaining architecture-planning TODOs into either completed or explicitly moved items so that note can stop acting like an implementation backlog.

I’m writing the bootstrap task as an implementation-bearing note, not as another architecture memo. I’m also tightening the old architecture-planning note with explicit carry-forward/reset summaries so its remaining TODOs can be closed or moved cleanly.

The architecture note is almost closeable now. One leftover TODO is just the “review old docs in depth” item, which at this point is more historical than actionable. I’m marking it complete so the note can function as a finished planning artifact instead of a half-open task.

The architecture-planning note now has its remaining implementation work explicitly moved and its TODOs closed. I’m doing a final readback and status check before I summarize how I’d treat `wd.task` vs `wd.completed` going forward.

I’m checking the current notes and git state first so I can answer against the actual files, then I’ll summarize whether anything still belongs in `wd.completed` and what the new bootstrap task contains.

I’ve confirmed the new bootstrap note exists and the architecture task now points to it. I’m checking the existing `wd.completed.*` pattern next so the recommendation about where decisions live matches how this repo is already using completion notes.

I’ve got enough context to answer the decision-placement question. I’m checking the checkbox state in the architecture note once more so I can tell you whether it’s actually ready to close, not just “mostly there.”

The architecture note is now effectively closeable: every checkbox is either done or explicitly moved to the bootstrap task. I’m grabbing exact line numbers for the key sections so the handoff is precise.

You do not have to move decisions out of the task note just to close it.

The clean split here is:
- keep task-local reasoning and decision context in the task note
- record durable project decisions in [[wd.decision-log|wd.decision-log.md]]
- use `wd.completed.*` only if you want a completion summary or retrospective

So I would not move the architecture decisions into `wd.completed` as their canonical home. If you write a `wd.completed` note for this task, it should summarize outcomes and point back to the task and decision log, not duplicate all the decision text.

The bootstrap task is now written at [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create|wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create.md]]. It carries the actual implementation checklist starting at [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create|wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create.md]]. I also moved the remaining implementation-bearing items out of the architecture note, and its TODO section is now fully resolved with those two items explicitly canceled-and-moved to the bootstrap task at [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning|wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning.md]]. The architecture note now says directly that implementation work moved to the bootstrap task at [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning|wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning.md]].

My recommendation for next steps is:
1. Treat [[wd.task.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]] as closeable now.
2. Skip a `wd.completed` note unless you want a short retrospective artifact.
3. Start executing the bootstrap task in order: scaffold Deno project, narrow Kato logging extraction, write/refine the `mesh create` spec, then add failing tests.

No tests ran here because this was docs-only. I left the untracked [`.kato-workspace-config.yaml`](.kato-workspace-config.yaml) untouched.

# User_2026-04-03_1938_21

In general, I want to rename wd.task.* to wd.completed.* to track whether they are done. 

I'm not sure the use of Accord is emphasized enough in [[wd.testing]] 

Should we start a new chat for the bootstrap task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1938_33

I’m checking the current testing note before I answer so I can say whether Accord is underweighted and, if so, patch it cleanly instead of hand-waving.

I’m updating the guidance now. The gap is real: `wd.testing` mentions Accord, but only as a side note; it should say more explicitly that Accord is the higher-level acceptance harness for externally visible Semantic Flow behavior.

I’m adding the naming convention to the main guidance too, because otherwise the `wd.task` to `wd.completed` move will stay implicit and drift across notes.

The guidance patches are in. I’m grabbing exact line references so the close-out can point you to the new convention and the new Accord emphasis directly.

Yes, with one constraint: keep `wd.task.*` for active work, and rename to `wd.completed.*` only when the task is materially done. I updated the repo guidance to say that explicitly in [[wd.general-guidance|wd.general-guidance.md]]. I would not bulk-rename old notes unless the status signal is worth the link churn. The architecture-planning note is a good candidate to rename now; the bootstrap note is not.

I agreed on Accord being under-emphasized. I tightened [[wd.testing|wd.testing.md]] and added a dedicated “Acceptance and Accord” section in [[wd.testing|wd.testing.md]]. The testing note now says more plainly that Accord is the preferred acceptance harness for externally visible Semantic Flow behavior, especially manifest-backed fixture transitions.

On the bootstrap task: a new chat is not required, but I would start one. The current thread has mostly settled architecture and note-structure decisions; the next phase is execution. A fresh chat will keep the Kato archive cleaner and the implementation context tighter, with [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create|wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create.md]] as the starting brief.

Docs only here; no tests ran.

# User_2026-04-03_1941_49

Can you suggest a prompt for the new bootstrap task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-03_1942_11

I’d use a prompt that is implementation-bearing from the start, not another planning pass.

```text
We’re starting the first real Weave implementation task.

Read these first:

Current decisions to follow:

- Weave is Deno-first.
- The public Semantic Flow API stays in semantic-flow-framework for now and should remain thin.
- The first carried slice is `mesh create`.
- Semantic logic lives below the daemon in shared `core` and `runtime`.
- The CLI must support local/in-process execution and will use Cliffy.
- Persistent config should be RDF, probably JSON-LD, and queryable via SPARQL.
- Accord is the preferred acceptance harness for externally visible Semantic Flow behavior.
- Reuse Kato logging where the extraction stays narrow and coherent.
- TUI is deferred.

What I want from you:

1. Review the current repo state and confirm what already exists versus what still needs scaffolding.
2. Propose a short concrete implementation plan for the first bootstrap slice.
3. Then execute the first meaningful chunk of work, not just analysis.

Execution priorities:

- Start by scaffolding the first Deno project structure if it is still missing.
- Define the first-pass logging extraction plan from Kato.
- Add or refine a `wd.spec.*` note for `mesh create` if needed.
- Add failing tests first where practical.
- Implement the first local/in-process `mesh create` slice over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Use Accord-oriented acceptance thinking for any externally visible behavior.

Constraints:

- Do not turn this into another architecture-only discussion.
- Do not build the full daemon yet.
- Do not write the full OpenAPI yet.
- Do not introduce a TUI.
- Do not over-package the repo before the first slice exists.
- Use apply_patch for file edits.
- Keep root README user-facing.
- Follow Dendron note conventions in documentation/notes.

Please work directly in the repo, make the changes, run the relevant tests/checks you can run, and report what changed, what passed, and what remains open.
```

If you want, I can also give you a tighter variant that is specifically “scaffold + logging extraction only” for a smaller first implementation turn.
