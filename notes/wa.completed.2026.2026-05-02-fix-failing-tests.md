## Goals

- Restore the failing `tests/integration/weave_test.ts` page-definition/source-resolution cluster on `next/v0.0.1`.
- Separate current page-definition regressions or fixture drift from the payload manifestation version-naming work.
- Make `next/v0.0.1` mergeable to `main` with a clean CI story.
- Keep [[wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar]] moving only on source/fixture planning until this branch-level test debt is resolved.

## Summary

The `next/v0.0.1` branch had passing typecheck/lint and passing focused payload `manifestationSegment` coverage, but was not merge-ready because a page-definition/source-resolution test cluster was failing.

The failures were not in the fantasy-rules sidecar fixture and did not appear to be caused by payload manifestation naming. They were concentrated around Alice Bio page-definition rendering and source resolution, especially current artifact-backed page sources, page definitions that use `workingFilePath`, and repo-adjacent `targetMeshPath` policy cases.

This was treated as a release-branch stabilization task and a blocker for merging `next/v0.0.1` into `main`. It did not need to block Phase 0 or source-only work for [[wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar]], but it blocked any fantasy-rules sidecar phases that rely on generated page behavior or on the sidecar branch being merged.

## Current Status

Resolved on `next/v0.0.1`.

The original failing page-definition/source-resolution cluster now passes. The root cause was fixture/test drift around the Alice page-definition source shape; the intended current contract remains latest ontology terms only, especially `sfc:targetMeshPath`, not legacy `WorkspaceRelativeFile`/`workspaceRelativePath` page-source resolution. The Alice Bio fixture branch was published with the corrected current source terms, Weave tests now rely on that fixed fixture rather than local overlays, and Resource Page HTML conformance checks were separately removed from SFF manifests so generated/custom Resource Page contents are no longer cross-repo snapshot contracts.

Validation completed on 2026-05-02:

- `deno task fmt`
- `deno task fmt:check`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`
- `deno task test` (`220 passed | 0 failed`)

## Discussion

Known passing checks as of 2026-05-02:

- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`
- focused payload manifestation/version naming tests
- focused CLI payload version naming tests

Known failing command:

```sh
deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env tests/integration/weave_test.ts --filter '/page-customized-woven|artifact-backed page sources|workingFilePath literals|targetMeshPath/'
```

Latest observed result:

- 1 passed
- 7 failed
- 19 filtered out

Failing tests:

- `executeWeave matches the settled alice page-customized-woven fixture`
- `executeWeave resolves current artifact-backed page sources through hasTargetArtifact`
- `executeWeave resolves artifact-backed page sources through workingFilePath when repo policy permits them`
- `executeWeave fails closed when artifact-backed page sources request pinned resolution`
- `executeWeave resolves page definitions from workingFilePath literals`
- `executeWeave fails closed when targetMeshPath escapes the mesh root without operational policy`
- `executeWeave allows repo-adjacent targetMeshPath values when repo policy permits them`

Passing adjacent test:

- `executeWeave resolves payload current files from workingFilePath literals`

Observed failure modes:

- The settled Alice page-customized fixture and the workingFilePath-literal page-definition case fail during `executeGenerate` with `ResourcePageDefinition region main for alice uses distribution/located-file targets that this first implementation slice does not support yet.`
- Several artifact-backed and `targetMeshPath` policy tests fail earlier in test setup because `replaceFileText` cannot find the expected page-source snippet in `alice/_knop/_page/page.ttl`.

Those two failure modes point to either fixture-shape drift, implementation drift, or both:

- The carried Alice Bio page-definition source may have moved from the older `targetMeshPath "mesh-content/sidebar.md"` shape to a distribution/located-file target shape.
- The runtime still treats distribution/located-file page-source targets as unsupported in this implementation slice.
- Some tests still patch the older page-source text directly, so they may be stale even if the newer fixture shape is intentional.

The fix should start by inspecting the actual `14-alice-page-customized` and `15-alice-page-customized-woven` fixture files and their corresponding conformance manifests before changing runtime behavior. A stale test should be updated; a stale fixture should be regenerated or corrected; a real missing runtime contract should be implemented.

## Open Issues

- Is the distribution/located-file page-source shape in the current Alice Bio fixture intentional and already part of the intended contract, or did the fixture drift ahead of runtime support?
- Should distribution/located-file page-source targets be supported now, or should the fixture be restored to the existing `targetMeshPath` / artifact-backed source contract?
- Are the tests that patch `alice/_knop/_page/page.ttl` with literal string replacement still the right shape, or should they use RDF-aware edits or fixture helpers?
- Which conformance manifests should be treated as authoritative for the Alice page-customization transition after the renderer refresh work?

## Decisions

- Treat this as a `next/v0.0.1` merge blocker.
- Do not treat these failures as caused by the fantasy-rules sidecar source fixture unless investigation proves otherwise.
- Do not block fantasy-rules Phase 0/source-only work on this task.
- Block generated-page sidecar phases and `next/v0.0.1` merge until these tests are either fixed or deliberately retired with replacement coverage.
- Keep raw conversation transcripts out of this note; link only distilled context if needed.

## Contract Changes

- No new contract should be assumed at task start.
- If distribution/located-file page-source targets are intentional, define the runtime contract for resolving them before updating tests to depend on it.
- If the intended contract remains `targetMeshPath` and current artifact-backed sources only, restore the Alice fixture and tests to that contract.
- Keep fail-closed local path policy behavior for repo-adjacent `targetMeshPath` and `workingFilePath` inputs.

## Testing

- Preserve the currently passing focused payload manifestation/version naming coverage.
- Restore the failing `tests/integration/weave_test.ts` page-definition/source-resolution cluster.
- Run the narrow failing-test command until it passes.
- Run at least:
  - `deno task lint`
  - `deno task check`
  - `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- Before merging `next/v0.0.1`, run `deno task test` or document any remaining known non-deterministic/environmental failures.

## Non-Goals

- Building or weaving the fantasy-rules sidecar fixture.
- Changing payload `manifestationSegment` behavior unless the investigation finds a direct dependency.
- Migrating default payload manifestation segments from filename-derived defaults to extension-derived defaults.
- Reworking the entire page renderer.
- Replacing Accord conformance manifests with implementation tests.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Re-run and record the exact failure baseline from `tests/integration/weave_test.ts`.
- [x] Inspect `14-alice-page-customized` and `15-alice-page-customized-woven` fixture contents for `alice/_knop/_page/page.ttl`, generated `alice/index.html`, and related inventory RDF.
- [x] Inspect the corresponding Alice Bio conformance manifests for the page-customization transition.
- [x] Decide whether distribution/located-file page-source targets are an intended contract or fixture drift.
- [x] If the tests are stale, update them to patch or assert against the current fixture shape without weakening the behavioral contract.
- [x] Determine that distribution/located-file page-source support is not part of this release contract; keep unsupported shapes fail-closed.
- [x] Restore artifact-backed page-source tests for current resolution, `workingFilePath`, and pinned-mode rejection.
- [x] Restore `targetMeshPath` policy tests for both denied traversal and explicitly allowed repo-adjacent paths.
- [x] Run the narrow failing-test command until all listed failures pass.
- [x] Run `deno task lint`.
- [x] Run `deno task check`.
- [x] Run `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env tests/integration/weave_test.ts`.
- [x] Run or queue full `deno task test` before marking `next/v0.0.1` merge-ready.
