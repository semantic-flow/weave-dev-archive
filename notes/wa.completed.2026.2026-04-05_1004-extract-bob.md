## Goals

- Carry the next real local semantic slice after [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven]].
- Implement the first local or in-process `extract` path over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Add a dedicated behavior spec note for `extract` rather than leaving the new operation implicit in fixture diffs alone.
- Keep this first extraction implementation narrow enough to prove referenced-resource extraction behavior without absorbing Bob weaving, payload splitting, or a generic graph-refactoring system.

## Summary

This task should follow the carried local `10-alice-bio-updated` -> `11-alice-bio-v2-woven` `weave` slice.

The next carried slice should target the settled Alice Bio transition from `11-alice-bio-v2-woven` to `12-bob-extracted`.

The target behavior is deliberately narrow:

- update `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` to register `bob/_knop` as a new current mesh member
- create `bob/_knop/_meta/meta.ttl`
- create `bob/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl`
- create `bob/_knop/_references/references.ttl`
- create a single `ReferenceLink` rooted at `bob/_knop/_references#reference001` with `ReferenceRole/Supplemental`
- point that new Supplemental link at `alice/bio` and explicitly at `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002`
- leave `alice-bio.ttl`, `alice/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl`, `alice/_knop/_references/references.ttl`, and `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl` unchanged
- do not generate any Bob ResourcePages yet; `bob/index.html`, `bob/_knop/index.html`, `bob/_knop/_meta/index.html`, `bob/_knop/_inventory/index.html`, and `bob/_knop/_references/index.html` should all remain absent

This task should prove the first non-woven referenced-resource extraction path without absorbing `13-bob-extracted-woven`, payload-byte splitting, or broad graph-rewrite abstractions.

## Discussion

### Why this is the next slice

The settled fixture ladder still makes the next carried sequence clear:

- semantic change
- weave

After `11-alice-bio-v2-woven`, the next missing implementation-bearing step is the non-woven extraction of `bob` into a minimal Knop-managed surface.

Jumping straight to `13-bob-extracted-woven` would blur the same boundary the fixture ladder is trying to preserve:

- `extract` creates Bob's current Knop-managed resources and updates the current mesh inventory
- the later `weave` versions, validates, and generates the Bob-facing page surface afterward

### Why this slice should stay narrow

The settled `12` fixture is deliberately small. The actual semantic result is meaningful, but the filesystem delta is tight:

- one updated current mesh inventory
- three new Bob support-artifact Turtle files
- no new generated pages
- no new explicit histories yet
- no change to the current payload bytes

That makes this a good carried slice because it proves referenced-resource extraction behavior directly without conflating it with weaving or presentation.

### What extraction means in this first slice

For the settled Alice Bio `12` target, extraction does not mean "split Bob out of the current payload bytes."

The payload stays intact. The extracted result is instead:

- a new Knop for `bob`
- minimal Bob support artifacts
- a `Supplemental` reference from `bob` back to `alice/bio`
- an explicit `referenceTargetState` pointing to the current woven Alice Bio payload state at `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002`

This should stay the carried semantic boundary for the first local `extract` path.

### Existing spec posture

This slice should get a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior]] note before implementation.

Unlike `weave`, `integrate`, `knop.create`, `knop.addReference`, and `payload.update`, there is no current behavior note for `extract`, and this is the first carried slice with a distinct machine-facing `extract` operation.

The existing [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]] and [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]] notes should be treated as neighboring context, not as substitutes for a real `extract` behavior note.

### Request-boundary posture

The first carried `extract` slice should stay fixture-first and narrow.

That means:

- the local implementation should center on the settled `targetDesignatorPath` `bob`
- it should resolve the Bob extraction from the current Alice Bio payload surface proven by the fixture rather than trying to solve generic multi-source disambiguation
- it should not attempt a broad "extract arbitrary subgraph into arbitrary artifact family" abstraction

If this first slice exposes a real need for a wider request shape, that should be made explicit in the new behavior note rather than guessed in the implementation.

### Acceptance-boundary posture

The `12` fixture repo also changes `README.md`, but that is cross-cutting fixture ladder narration, not semantic operation output.

The black-box CLI acceptance for this slice should stay manifest-scoped and file-expectation-driven rather than treating unrelated fixture-documentation churn as part of `extract` behavior.

## Resolved Questions

- The machine-facing job kind and manifest `operationId` should stay `extract`.
- `extract` should get a dedicated `wd.spec.*` note before implementation rather than being folded into the weave or add-reference notes.
- The first carried slice should create a Bob Knop and Bob-owned support artifacts without creating a Bob payload artifact.
- The first carried slice should use `ReferenceRole/Supplemental` for the extracted Bob link and should explicitly record `referenceTargetState <alice/bio/_history001/_s0002>`.
- The first carried slice should leave current payload bytes and generated pages unchanged.
- The first carried slice should keep broader source-selection ambiguity, payload splitting, and graph-surgery abstractions out of scope.

## Decisions

- Treat `11-alice-bio-v2-woven` -> `12-bob-extracted` as the next carried implementation slice.
- Add a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior]] note for this slice.
- Keep the first `extract` implementation local or in-process over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Use the settled Alice Bio `12-bob-extracted` manifest and fixture as the first acceptance target.
- Keep the slice non-woven: update current mesh inventory and create current Bob support-artifact Turtle files only.
- Create a Bob `ReferenceCatalog` with one Supplemental link back to `alice/bio`, pinned to `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002`.
- Do not create any Bob ResourcePages in this step.
- Do not split `bob` out of `alice-bio.ttl` in this step.
- Keep black-box CLI acceptance manifest-scoped rather than coupling it to unrelated fixture `README.md` churn.
- Do not absorb `13-bob-extracted-woven`, payload splitting, daemon work, or the broader RDF cleanup task into this note.

## Contract Changes

- This task may introduce the first thin public request/result examples for `extract` in `semantic-flow-framework`.
- This task should not broaden the public contract into a generic resource-extraction, payload-splitting, or subgraph-rewrite API beyond what the carried `11` -> `12` slice actually proves.

## Testing

- Follow [[wd.testing]].
- Add failing unit tests for narrow `extract` planning and validation logic where practical.
- Start with failing integration and black-box CLI tests against the settled `12-bob-extracted` fixture target so the non-woven boundary is locked in before implementation.
- Add integration tests for local filesystem results against the settled `12-bob-extracted` fixture target.
- Add a black-box CLI acceptance test scoped by the settled `12-bob-extracted` Accord manifest.
- Keep the comparison black-box and fixture-oriented, with strong checks that Bob ResourcePages remain absent and existing Alice surfaces remain unchanged.
- Keep the CLI acceptance manifest-scoped rather than requiring full-tree equality with unrelated fixture-documentation changes.

## Non-Goals

- implementing `13-bob-extracted-woven`
- creating Bob histories under `bob/_knop/_meta/_history001/...`, `bob/_knop/_inventory/_history001/...`, or `bob/_knop/_references/_history001/...`
- generating Bob ResourcePages
- splitting `bob` into a separate payload artifact
- changing `alice-bio.ttl`
- introducing a generic RDF extraction or graph-rewrite framework
- implementing daemon endpoints

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Draft [[wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior]] and settle the first local request/result boundary for `extract`.
- [x] Define the first local CLI surface for the carried `extract` operation.
- [x] Add failing integration and black-box CLI tests for the narrow `11` -> `12` extraction behavior, then add unit tests where a real planning or validation seam appears.
- [x] Implement the first local or in-process `extract` path over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- [c] Draft or refine the thin public API example or contract fragment for `extract` in `semantic-flow-framework` if this slice sharpens the public contract.
- [x] Update relevant overview/spec/framework notes as the slice settles.

## Outcome

The carried `11-alice-bio-v2-woven` -> `12-bob-extracted` slice is now implemented locally.

- shared `core` now plans a narrow `extract` slice by composing the existing `knop.create` and `knop.addReference` patterns, while adding extract-specific `referenceTargetState` handling and fixture-aligned file ordering
- local `runtime` now resolves the source payload artifact by scanning the current woven payload surfaces in the workspace, requiring exactly one woven payload artifact to mention the requested target designator, and pinning the created Bob link to that source artifact's latest historical state
- local `cli` now exposes `weave extract <designatorPath>` as the first carried human-facing extract surface
- focused unit, integration, and manifest-scoped black-box CLI coverage now lock the carried `12` slice against the settled Alice Bio fixture while keeping Bob ResourcePages absent and ignoring unrelated fixture `README.md` churn
- no additional `semantic-flow-framework` contract update was needed for this slice because the existing `extract` vocabulary and `12-bob-extracted` manifest already fit the carried local boundary
