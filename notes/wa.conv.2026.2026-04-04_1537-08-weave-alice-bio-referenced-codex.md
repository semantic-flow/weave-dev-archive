08 weave alice bio referenced

Review [[AGENTS]] and [[dev.general-guidance]] and [[dev.testing]] and then let's settle the open issues.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1530_23

I’m pulling the repo guidance and the task note first so I can ground the discussion in the project’s actual constraints before touching the open issues.

I’ve got the repo-level constraints. Next I’m checking the existing notes and code surface around reference links so the decisions land on what the project already does, not a speculative API.

The next decision point is the API shape. I’m reading the existing spec language and CLI patterns so I can resolve the three open questions with a concrete recommendation instead of just replacing them with guesses.

The docs already narrow two things: CLI actions are grouped as `mesh create`, `knop create`, and `integrate`, and stable reference-link fragment IDs are explicit. I’m reading the ontology notes now to settle the remaining request-shape question cleanly.

The ontology note closes the subject question pretty hard: `referenceLinkFor` points to the actual subject resource, not the `Knop`. I’m checking the current `core` and `runtime` layout now so the CLI recommendation matches how the repo is actually structured.

The code layout reinforces one choice already: the user-facing CLI is space-delimited subcommands, while dotted names are just audit/event IDs. I’m checking the existing tests and fixture harness now so the note update lines up with current acceptance patterns.

I’ve got enough context to make the calls. Before editing, I’m checking the worktree so I don’t trample any unrelated user changes in the same note or neighboring docs.

There’s already a draft API shape for `knop.addReference` in the framework repo. I’m reading that before I lock the note, because if the task note fights the draft contract now we’ll just be creating avoidable cleanup.

The task note is clear enough to edit directly, but the repo’s own testing guidance says to write/refine a `wd.spec.*` note when behavior is still unclear. I’m reading the existing integrate spec so I can either mirror that pattern cleanly or avoid inventing a new style.

I’m updating the task note now to replace the unresolved questions with explicit decisions, and I’m adding the dedicated behavior spec the repo guidance calls for so the implementation slice is actually pinned down before code work starts.

The ambiguity is replaced with concrete decisions now. I’m reading both notes back once to catch any stale wording or mismatched scope before I hand this off.

One wording point was sloppy: the `Knop` owns the catalog, while the referent is the subject of the link. I’m tightening that now so the spec doesn’t encode the wrong relationship.

Settled the open issues in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-alice-bio-referenced]] and added the dedicated behavior spec at [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]].

The decisions are now explicit:
- first local CLI: `weave knop add-reference <designatorPath> --reference-target-designator-path <referenceTargetDesignatorPath>`
- machine-facing job kind / manifest `operationId` stays `knop.addReference`
- first slice hard-codes `ReferenceRole/Canonical`
- `referenceLinkFor` is implicit from the targeted Knop’s referent, not a separate input
- local request/result stays narrow: `designatorPath` + `referenceTargetDesignatorPath`, with result reporting `referenceCatalogIri`, `referenceLinkIri`, and changed paths

I also marked the first three implementation-plan items as resolved. No tests run; this was a documentation-only change.

# User_2026-04-04_1537_20

I think we should take ReferenceRole as input. If not specified, I'd say it would default to Supplemental.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1537_40

I’m checking the ontology and the carried `08` fixture before changing the decision, because this is exactly the kind of place where a “reasonable default” can quietly diverge from the settled scenario.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1538_15

I checked the ontology and the carried manifest. The important conflict is that the settled `08` acceptance target is explicitly `Canonical`, not just “some reference role,” so a silent default to `Supplemental` would only be safe if the caller always overrides it for this first slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1538_44

I’m revising the note and the spec to take `ReferenceRole` as an input, but I’m not going to encode a silent `Supplemental` default into this first carried slice. That default is broader policy, and the first covered omission case does not exist yet.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1539_11

The compromise is in place: role is now an input, but the first local slice requires it explicitly instead of silently inventing semantics on omission. I’m reading the diffs once to make sure the note and spec still agree with each other.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1539_20

I’ve got the docs consistent. I’m grabbing exact line references now so the reasoning and the edited decisions point at the concrete sources, not just my summary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1539_31

Updated the docs to take `referenceRole` as input on the first local surface: [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-alice-bio-referenced#L85]] and [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior#L21]] now use `weave knop add-reference <designatorPath> --reference-target-designator-path <referenceTargetDesignatorPath> --reference-role <referenceRole>` and treat `referenceRole` as part of the narrow local request shape.

I did not adopt a silent `Supplemental` default. The settled `08` acceptance target explicitly asserts `ReferenceRole/Canonical` for this first carried slice in [08-alice-bio-referenced.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/08-alice-bio-referenced.jsonld#L29) and [08-alice-bio-referenced.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/08-alice-bio-referenced.jsonld#L161), while the ontology defines the role vocabulary but no default in [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L210). So the docs now require the role explicitly for this first local slice instead of inventing omission semantics. If you want a global `Supplemental` default later, that should get its own spec and fixture.

No tests run.

# User_2026-04-04_1541_06

OK proceed. I guess spec is next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1541_21

The spec note is already in place at [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]]. I’m moving to the next real step now: failing tests and the first local `knop add-reference` implementation against the settled `08` fixture.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1541_54

I’ve got the fixture shape and test patterns. Next I’m wiring the new `core`/`runtime`/CLI slice and adding the matching unit, integration, and e2e tests against `07 -> 08`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1544_11

I’m editing the implementation now. The main risk is path and Turtle mutation, so I’m keeping the new slice isolated in `knop/add_reference` and deriving the tests directly from the settled `07 -> 08` fixture.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1546_21

The slice is wired end-to-end now. I’m doing the cleanup pass next: formatting, compile fixes, and then the targeted test run to see what the fixture comparisons disagree with.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1546_34

The code is through typechecking and into the test run. I’m polling the failures now; the likely friction is exact Turtle insertion order or the CLI wiring.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1546_47

The first test pass exposed exactly the two expected friction points: one CLI parsing bug and one inventory insertion-order mismatch against the settled `08` file. I’m fixing those now rather than broadening the scope.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1547_17

The second pass is through typechecking again. I’m checking whether the remaining failures are semantic or just exact fixture formatting.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1547_23

The new slice passes its own unit, integration, and e2e acceptance tests. I’m running the repo test task now to make sure the new command didn’t break adjacent slices.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1547_50

The feature is implemented and the full repo test task is green. I’m doing one last repo-hygiene pass now: task-note status and any lightweight documentation updates that the completed slice made concrete.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1548_01

The code is done. I’m closing the loop on the task note now so the implementation status matches reality, and I’m checking whether there’s a minimal decision-log or overview update worth making instead of leaving the docs behind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1548_13

The implementation is green. I’m making the note trail match that reality now: closing the task checklist, adding the decision-log entry, and updating the overview so the next slice doesn’t start from stale repo docs.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1548_37

I’m renaming the task note to `wd.completed.*` and fixing the live links with it. That keeps `wd.todo`, the decision log, and the overview aligned with the implemented slice instead of leaving a finished task open.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1549_24

The note trail is now closed forward, but I’m doing one quick link sweep to catch any stale `wd.task...alice-bio-referenced` references left behind by the rename.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1549_55

Implemented the first local `knop add-reference` slice end-to-end. The new CLI surface is wired in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts#L175), core planning and Turtle mutation live in [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L16), and local execution/logging live in [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L13). It now creates `alice/_knop/_references/references.ttl`, updates the existing Knop inventory to register the `ReferenceCatalog`, derives `referenceLinkFor` from the target designator, and requires an explicit `referenceRole` token that maps to the ontology IRI.

I added unit, integration, and black-box CLI coverage in [add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/knop/add_reference_test.ts), [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L13), and [knop_add_reference_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/knop_add_reference_cli_test.ts#L18). I also closed the note trail: the task note is now [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-alice-bio-referenced]], with matching updates to [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]], [[wd.decision-log]], [[wd.codebase-overview]], and [[wd.todo]]. I did not change `semantic-flow-framework`; the existing draft `knop.addReference` surface was enough for this local slice.

Verification: `deno task test`

commit message please

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1550_28

I’m checking the current diff summary so the commit message matches the actual change set, including the task-note rename and doc updates.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1550_31

The tracked diff omits the new files, so I’m pulling the worktree status too before I draft the message.

feat(knop): implement first local add-reference slice

- add core planning and local runtime execution for `knop.addReference`
- wire `weave knop add-reference` into the CLI with explicit target designator and `referenceRole`
- add unit, integration, and black-box CLI tests for the settled `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` -> `08-alice-bio-referenced` fixture
- add `[[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]]` for the first carried reference-catalog behavior
- rename the task note to completed and update `wd.todo`, `wd.decision-log`, `wd.codebase-overview`, and related conversation links
```

# User_2026-04-04_1553_05

In the future let me move the task files to completed. 

Maybe add that to Agents.md

Can you compose the next slice task item. Includ the time in the filename, like _1553

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1553_14

I’m updating the repo guidance first so it doesn’t keep telling agents to rename task notes, then I’ll draft the next carried-slice note with the requested `_1553` timestamped filename.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1553_36

I’ve got the current queue. I’m reading the settled `09` fixture guidance and the last weave task pattern now so the new `_1553` task note is concrete instead of just “next is 09”.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1553_48

I’ve got the transition shape. I’m checking the actual `09` inventory and page outputs now so the note captures the real weave consequences, especially the “advance Knop inventory but not mesh inventory” boundary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1553_58

I’m writing three doc changes now: the “don’t rename task notes unless asked” guidance, the new `_1553` weave task note for `08 -> 09`, and the todo update so the next slice is actually queued.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1554_34

The new task note and guidance updates are in place. I’m reading them back once to make sure the filename, wikilinks, and the “user handles renames” rule all landed cleanly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1554_41

Added the “leave task-note renames to the user unless explicitly asked” rule to [[AGENTS]] and also to [[wd.general-guidance]] so the repo guidance doesn’t contradict itself.

Drafted the next carried-slice task note at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]] and queued it in [[wd.todo]]. It scopes the next slice to `08-alice-bio-referenced -> 09-alice-bio-referenced-woven`: weave `alice/_knop/_references`, advance `alice/_knop/_inventory`, generate the catalog pages, and leave `_mesh/_inventory` unchanged.

No tests run; this was a docs-only update.

# User_2026-04-04_1634_40

coderabbit feedback:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

Inline comments:
In `@src/cli/run.ts`:
- Around line 198-227: Trim and validate the positional designatorPath inside
the .action handler before using it: call designatorPath =
String(designatorPath).trim() (or equivalent) after it is received, then check
it is non-empty and if invalid throw/return a clear error (same pattern as
resolveRequiredOptionValue) so execution (including executeKnopAddReference and
auditLogger.command) never proceeds with a whitespace-only value; update any
error message to mention the positional designatorPath.

In `@src/core/knop/add_reference.ts`:
- Around line 50-68: normalizeDesignatorPath currently allows segments like
"alice:bio" that can produce non-mesh-relative IRIs; update
normalizeDesignatorPath to validate each segment against a safe segment charset
(only allow a-z, A-Z, 0-9, hyphen, underscore, dot — reject colons, slashes,
spaces, etc.), and throw a clear validation error when a segment fails. In
add_reference.ts (places constructing designatorPath and
referenceTargetDesignatorPath and where toKnopPath is used) call the tightened
normalizeDesignatorPath and ensure any invalid input causes fast failure rather
than producing IRIs; mirror the identical charset check in the runtime validator
code paths mentioned (the blocks around lines 117-153 and 168-185) so both
compile-time and runtime enforce the same rule. Ensure error messages reference
the offending segment and the function names normalizeDesignatorPath and
toKnopPath for easy debugging.
- Around line 155-165: The normalizeReferenceRole function currently uses the
"in" operator against referenceRoleIriByToken which matches prototype properties
(e.g., "constructor"); change the validation to check only own properties by
using Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(referenceRoleIriByToken, normalized)
instead of "normalized in referenceRoleIriByToken", keep throwing
KnopAddReferenceInputError for empty/unsupported values and return the
normalized value as ReferenceRoleToken as before.

In `@src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts`:
- Around line 102-108: The workspace mutation is not atomic because
writeCreatedFiles and writeUpdatedFiles commit changes before all work (and
success logging) completes; modify the add-reference flow so mutations are done
atomically: for created files use a staging-and-rename strategy (write to temp
paths then atomically rename into final paths) or implement a rollback path that
removes any newly created files if a later step fails, and ensure
writeUpdatedFiles applies updates transactionally (e.g., write to temp files and
replace). Keep the pre-checks (assertReferenceTargetExists,
assertCreateTargetsDoNotExist) as-is but perform the staged commit immediately
after those checks and before any post-commit logging; make the success log
calls best-effort (catch/log but don’t throw) so logging failures do not leave
the workspace mutated without allowing retries. Ensure the new behavior is
applied to both the block around writeCreatedFiles/writeUpdatedFiles and the
other occurrence noted (lines ~159-188) so all workspace mutations are atomic.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1635_10

I’m verifying the actual code paths against the review comments first, then I’ll patch only the findings that are real for the current `knop add-reference` slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1635_57

Verifying the CodeRabbit findings against the current implementation now. I’m checking each one in the live code, then I’ll patch only the issues that are real and add tests where the behavior changed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1636_06

The three substantive findings are real in the current tree: positional CLI validation is missing, path-segment validation is too permissive, and the runtime write path is not atomic. I’m patching those now and I’ll add focused regression coverage for the new failure cases instead of changing unrelated behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1638_15

I’ve narrowed the fix scope to the actual regressions in `knop add-reference`. I’m editing the CLI first so whitespace-only positional input is rejected before any audit logging or runtime execution.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1638_21

Next I’m tightening the designator-path normalization in the core planner. This is the place that was still willing to turn bad segments into IRIs, so I’m making the segment rule explicit and fixing the `referenceRole` own-property check at the same time.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1639_06

I’m on the runtime now. The change here is two parts: make the local validator match the planner’s segment rules, and stage the filesystem mutation so a later failure can roll back cleanly instead of leaving half-applied files behind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1639_44

The core planner changes are in. I’m adding regression tests now for the two concrete input bugs that were real: bad path segments like `alice:bio` and prototype-property tokens like `constructor`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1640_17

I’ve covered the planner and runtime. I’m adding one black-box CLI regression now so the whitespace-only positional case stays closed all the way out at the command surface.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1640_39

There’s one follow-up in the runtime patch: I’m making the post-commit cleanup actually best-effort so a temp-file cleanup miss can’t reintroduce the same “mutation succeeded but the command failed” class of problem.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1641_06

The fixes are patched. I’m formatting the touched files and then running the targeted `knop add-reference` tests first so I can catch any type or behavior regressions before deciding whether a full suite run is worth the extra time.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1641_10

The test compile step is past formatting and into execution. If anything fails now it should be a real behavioral mismatch, not just syntax or lint noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1641_16

The failures are permission-related, not code failures. I’m rerunning the same targeted tests with the permissions those integration and CLI cases actually need so we can see the real result set.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1641_27

The targeted regressions are green. I’m running the repo’s normal test task once to make sure the tighter validation and CLI surface didn’t break anything outside the `add-reference` slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1641_50

The code changes are done and the full repo test task passed. I’m just collecting the exact file/line references now so the close-out is precise and I can distinguish the actual fixes from unrelated workspace noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1642_20

I verified the CodeRabbit comments against the current code. The CLI positional validation issue, the unsafe designator-segment issue, the `referenceRole` own-property issue, and the non-atomic runtime write path were all real, so I fixed those and nothing broader.

- In [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts#L198), `knop add-reference` now trims and validates the positional `designatorPath` before any audit logging or execution, with a clear error that names the positional argument.
- In [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L122) and [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L170), `normalizeDesignatorPath` now rejects unsafe segments like `alice:bio` with an error that mentions `normalizeDesignatorPath` and `toKnopPath`, and `normalizeReferenceRole` now uses `hasOwnProperty` instead of `in`.
- In [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L311), [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L359), and [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L597), the runtime now enforces the same segment rule, stages file writes through temp files plus rollback, and treats success logging as best-effort so a committed mutation does not fail afterward.

I added regression coverage in [add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/knop/add_reference_test.ts#L157), [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L112), and [knop_add_reference_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/knop_add_reference_cli_test.ts#L103). Verification: `deno task test` passed.

There is also an unrelated modified note in the worktree, [[wa.conv.2026.2026-04-04_1537-08-weave-alice-bio-referenced-codex]], which I left alone.

# User_2026-04-04_2019_36

can you compose a task for the next slice?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2019_46

I’m checking the current `09` task note and the conformance sequence so the next slice note lands on the right transition and uses the same task-note structure.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2019_55

I’ve confirmed the current task is the `08 -> 09` weave slice, so the next real step is the `09 -> 10` semantic update. I’m reading the settled `10` manifest and nearby completed task patterns so the new note is scoped tightly instead of turning into a vague “update something” placeholder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2020_04

I have the next timestamp. I’m checking the actual `09 -> 10` fixture delta so the task note names the real semantic surface: which files should change, which ones must stay frozen, and whether this wants a new dedicated `payload.update` spec note or just a thin extension of the existing integrate/update guidance.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2020_27

The fixture delta is clean: `09 -> 10` changes only `alice-bio.ttl`, and the manifest names the operation `payload.update`. I’m drafting the task as a deliberately narrow non-woven semantic slice, not a general RDF-editing project and not the later `v2` weave.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2020_53

There isn’t an existing `payload.update` behavior spec, unlike `mesh.create`, `knop.create`, `integrate`, `knop.addReference`, and `weave`. I’m treating that as part of the task: queue the new semantic slice and make the task explicitly say a dedicated narrow `payload.update` spec should be written rather than smuggling the behavior into the weave note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2021_00

I have enough to draft it. The new task is going to be a narrow `payload.update` slice: one working payload file changes, every woven artifact stays frozen, and the later `11` weave remains explicitly out of scope.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2021_04

I’m writing the note now and queueing it in `wd.todo`. I’m also keeping the internal links in Dendron style and leaving the currently active `09` task untouched, since this is just the follow-on slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2022_14

The note is in place and queued. I’m giving it one quick pass for wording and linkage so the next person picking it up doesn’t get tripped by an accidental ambiguity in the scope or spec reference.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2022_18

Drafted the next slice task at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]. It queues the narrow `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven` -> `10-alice-bio-updated` `payload.update` slice, with the core constraint that only `alice-bio.ttl` changes and all woven support artifacts stay frozen.

I also added it to [[wd.todo#L10]], immediately after the current `09` weave task. No tests run; this was a docs-only update.

# User_2026-04-04_2023_30

update the implementation plan in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]]

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2023_42

I’m checking the current task note against the live code and tests so the implementation plan reflects what is already settled versus what still belongs to the `09` slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2023_54

The current plan still reads like an unsifted draft even though the note already settles a few of those questions in prose. I’m checking the prior task-note pattern so I can update this one consistently instead of just flipping boxes at random.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2024_19

I found the mismatch: the note already settles the spec and request-shape questions in prose, but the plan still treats them as open work. I’m tightening the plan so it shows those items as resolved and breaks the remaining `09` work into the concrete artifact/history, inventory, page, and acceptance steps that are actually left.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2024_30

The plan is updated. I’m doing a quick readback so I don’t leave the note with a plan that contradicts the earlier decisions section.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2024_35

Updated the implementation plan in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven#L131]].

The main change was to align the plan with what the note already settles:
- marked the spec-sufficiency and narrow-request-shape items complete
- removed the speculative framework-contract item
- split the remaining work into the actual `09` slice deliverables: tests, page-seam extension, `alice/_knop/_references` first-history weaving, `alice/_knop/_inventory` advancement with `_mesh/_inventory` unchanged, and the black-box acceptance test

No tests run; this was a docs-only edit.

fix the lint errors

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2029_51

I’m running the repo lint task first to get the actual failures from the current tree, then I’ll patch only the files that are still violating lint.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2029_56

The failures are narrow and confined to the new regression test doubles. I’m checking the sink interface and then I’ll make the smallest change that satisfies lint without changing test behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2029_57

I’ve got the cause: those sink stubs are allowed to be synchronous by the `LogSink` interface, so the `async` keywords are unnecessary. I’m removing them and rerunning lint.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2030_08

Fixed the lint errors in [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L151) by removing unnecessary `async` from the synchronous test sink stubs.

Verification: `deno task lint` now passes. I did not run the full test suite.

# User_2026-04-04_2153_30

What about : 

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

- Around line 121-148: The catch block currently awaits operationalLogger.error
and auditLogger.record and can throw, masking the original
KnopAddReference*Error; change it to preserve the original error (capture it as
originalErr), compute the message, then call operationalLogger.error and
auditLogger.record inside their own try/catch blocks (best-effort: swallow/log
any logging failures but do not let them throw), and finally rethrow the
originalErr so the original validation/commit failure is propagated; reference
operationalLogger.error, auditLogger.record and the surrounding catch for the
addReference flow.

In `@tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts`:
- Around line 151-169: The test sinks' async write(record) stubs in the
StructuredLogger used for throwingOperationalLogger and the inner
StructuredLogger passed to AuditLogger must explicitly return a Promise to
satisfy require-await; modify both write implementations (the write methods on
the StructuredLogger instances) to return Promise.reject(new Error("operational
success log failed")) / Promise.reject(new Error("audit success log failed"))
when record.event === "knop.addReference.succeeded" and return Promise.resolve()
otherwise so the failure injection still works but lint passes.

- Around line 501-504: The two-step swap in the loop
(Deno.rename(file.absolutePath, file.backupPath!) followed by
Deno.rename(file.tempPath, file.absolutePath)) is non-atomic because the
destination can be missing between awaits; change this to an atomic replace by
renaming the new file directly over the destination (use
Deno.rename(file.tempPath, file.absolutePath)) so the target path is never
missing. If you still need a backup, create it first with a non-destructive copy
(e.g., Deno.copyFile(file.absolutePath, file.backupPath!)) and then atomically
replace with Deno.rename(file.tempPath, file.absolutePath); update the loop in
add_reference.ts to use these operations on the
file.tempPath/file.absolutePath/file.backupPath symbols.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2159_13

I’m checking the live `knop add-reference` runtime and the current test double shape before touching anything. The failure-path logging and the updated-file commit loop are the two places that might still be real; the test-sink comment may already be stale after the lint fix.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2159_35

The live code confirms two of those review comments are still real: failure-path logging can mask the original error, and the updated-file commit path still moves the destination out of the way before replacement. The test-sink comment is stale now that those stubs are synchronous and `deno task lint` already passes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2159_47

I’m patching both real issues now: failure logging becomes best-effort so it can’t mask the underlying error, and the updated-file commit loop will stop moving the live destination out of the way before replacement. I’m also adding one regression test for the failure-path logging case so this doesn’t reopen later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2200_12

I’m patching the runtime in two spots now: the `catch` path will log best-effort and rethrow the original normalized failure, and the updated-file commit path will switch from rename-away-then-rename-in to backup-copy plus direct replacement. After that I’ll add a regression test for the failure-logging case.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2200_26

The runtime changes are in. I’m adding the regression test that forces the failure logger path to throw, so we prove the underlying add-reference error still surfaces instead of getting replaced by a logging error.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2200_43

I’ve added the regression coverage. Next I’m formatting the touched files and running the targeted `knop add-reference` tests plus lint so we can separate real behavior issues from simple formatting noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2200_46

Lint is clean. The targeted tests are compiling now; I’m waiting for the actual runtime results, especially the new failure-logging regression, before I touch anything else.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2200_50

The targeted `knop add-reference` suite is green. I’m running the normal repo test task once more because the runtime commit path changed, and that’s the quickest way to rule out spillover beyond the focused regression set.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2201_12

I verified all three review items against the current tree and the tests are green. I’m pulling exact line references now so the close-out can distinguish the two real fixes from the one stale comment I intentionally left alone.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2201_29

Two of those findings were still real, and I fixed them.

- Failure-path logging masking the original error: real. The `catch` in [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L121) now normalizes the original failure first, logs with best-effort helpers in [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L582), and rethrows the original normalized add-reference error instead of letting `operationalLogger.error` or `auditLogger.record` replace it.
- Updated-file commit leaving the destination missing between awaits: real. The updated-file commit loop in [add_reference.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L486) now copies the old file to backup and then renames the staged file directly onto the destination, instead of renaming the live destination away first.
- Promise-returning test sink comment: stale. The current sink stubs in [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L158) and [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L205) are synchronous now, which already satisfies the `LogSink` interface and the lint rule, so I did not change them to explicit `Promise.resolve()` / `Promise.reject()` forms.

I added a regression test for the failure-logging case in [knop_add_reference_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts#L142). Verification: `deno task lint` and `deno task test` both pass.

# User_2026-04-04_2209_36

commit mesg.

What next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2209_55

```text
fix(knop): preserve add-reference failures and tighten staged replace

- preserve the original add-reference error when failed-path logging throws
- use backup copy plus direct staged rename for updated-file commits
- add regression coverage for failed-path logging
```

Next should still be [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]], not [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]. `09` is the next carried fixture slice and it unblocks `10`. I’d start that task by adding the failing `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven` integration and black-box CLI acceptance tests, then extend the shared weave/page seam for `ReferenceCatalog` pages.

# User_2026-04-04_2212_01

new chat?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2212_11

Yes.

A fresh chat is the cleaner move for [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]]. The current thread has mixed docs work, `08` implementation, CodeRabbit follow-up, and queue management. Starting clean will make the `09` weave slice easier to track.

Use a handoff like:

```text
Implement [[wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]].

Context:
- `08-alice-bio-referenced` is implemented and passing.
- next carried slice is `08 -> 09`
- reuse [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]
- start with failing integration and black-box CLI tests against `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven`
- extend the shared weave/page seam for current and historical ReferenceCatalog pages
- keep `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` unchanged
- do not rename the task note to completed unless explicitly asked
```

If you want, I can also draft a tighter kickoff prompt for that new chat.
