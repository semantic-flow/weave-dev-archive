Implement [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]].

Context:
- `08-alice-bio-referenced` is implemented and passing.
- next carried slice is `08 -> 09`
- reuse [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]
- start with failing integration and black-box CLI tests against `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven`
- extend the shared weave/page seam for current and historical ReferenceCatalog pages
- keep `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` unchanged
- do not rename the task note to completed unless explicitly asked

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2220_30

I’m implementing `[[wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven]]` by first reading the repo guidance and the task/spec notes, then I’ll add failing integration and CLI coverage for `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven` before touching the implementation seam.

I’ve confirmed the worktree is clean. Next I’m pulling the task note, spec, and repo guidance into context so the test additions and seam changes stay aligned with the existing slice conventions.

The task note is explicit: lead with failing `09` integration and black-box CLI coverage, then extend the shared page-generation seam rather than forking a new path. I’m locating the existing `08` implementation, the `09` fixture ladder, and the test harnesses that already carry earlier slices.

I’ve got the fixture and ontology constraints in hand. Next I’m reading the current weave planner/runtime and the existing `05`/`07` tests so I can add `09` in the same harness instead of inventing new test plumbing.

I’ve confirmed the current weave code only recognizes two slices: first Knop weave and first payload weave. There is no `ReferenceCatalog` path yet, so I’m inspecting the settled `08 -> 09` fixture diff now to mirror the exact artifact/history and page outputs instead of guessing them.

The `09` fixture is narrower than a generalized catalog renderer: one new inventory state, first catalog history, and a special current catalog page with a single current link anchor. I’m pulling the exact TTL blocks now so the new planner preserves the byte-for-byte working/snapshot invariants instead of merely graph-equivalent output.

The `09` slice exposes a real constraint in the runtime loader, not just missing render code: it currently drops any Knop whose inventory already has history, which was fine for `07` but makes `alice` in `08` invisible. I’m checking whether there’s any reusable history/version helper already in the codebase before I patch that path directly.

I have enough context to start the TDD pass. I’m editing the existing weave integration and black-box CLI suites to add `08 -> 09` cases first, with assertions focused on the catalog history, advanced Knop inventory, and unchanged mesh inventory.

The `09` cases are in. I’m running just the affected weave integration and CLI suites now to capture the current failure mode before I touch planner/runtime code.

The first run only exposed Deno permission gaps in the test harness, not product behavior. I’m rerunning with the permissions these fixture-driven tests actually need so we get the real `09` failure signal.

The failure is the expected one: `08` produces zero weave candidates because the runtime still filters out any Knop inventory that already has explicit history. The implementation work from here is:

- extend candidate discovery so a Knop with an already-versioned inventory can still be weaveable when its attached `ReferenceCatalog` is still only a working file
- add a narrow `firstReferenceCatalogWeave` planner path that:
  - snapshots `alice/_knop/_references/references.ttl` into `_history001/_s0001`
  - advances `alice/_knop/_inventory` from `_s0001` to `_s0002`
  - leaves `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` untouched
- extend the shared page seam with a `ReferenceCatalog` current-page model plus the first catalog-history pages so `alice/_knop/_references/index.html` renders the `#reference001` anchor from the current catalog
- backfill unit coverage around the new planner/page model, then rerun the targeted weave suites and the focused core/runtime tests that exercise the new seam

The integration and CLI regressions are enough to drive the runtime change, but I also want narrow planner/page assertions so we don’t end up debugging this only at the filesystem level. I’m adding one core weave test and one page-render test for the new `ReferenceCatalog` seam before implementing it.

I’m patching the core planner first: new candidate/page model types, a third weave-slice classification for a first `ReferenceCatalog` weave, and relaxed candidate prechecks so an already-versioned Knop inventory can still participate when the catalog itself is not yet woven.

The core path is in place. I’m wiring the runtime loader to discover a Knop as weaveable when its `ReferenceCatalog` is still only a working file, while continuing to ignore already-fully-woven Knops like `alice/bio`.

The new planner/runtime path is wired. I’m running the focused unit, integration, and black-box weave suites together now to catch type mismatches and exact-fixture drift before I touch any notes.

The code and focused tests are green. I’m doing the close-out docs pass required by the repo guidance now: task-note checkbox updates, then the minimal spec/overview/decision-log changes so the carried `09` slice is reflected accurately without renaming the task note.

I’m updating only the minimum docs the repo explicitly asks to keep in sync: the task note checklist, the weave behavior note’s carried-slice status, the codebase overview, and a new decision-log entry for the `08 -> 09` weave boundary.

I’ve finished the note updates. I’m formatting only the changed TypeScript files, not the markdown notes, so I don’t accidentally reflow the Dendron docs against the repo guidance.

The code is formatted. I’m doing the final verification pass now: the focused weave unit/integration/CLI suites again, plus a `git diff --check` sanity pass for whitespace and patch hygiene.

The verification pass is clean. I’m checking the final diff summary now so the close-out can stay high-signal and not miss any touched file category.

Implemented the `08-alice-bio-referenced -> 09-alice-bio-referenced-woven` slice. The core change is in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts#L12): there is now a third narrow local weave path for a first `ReferenceCatalog` weave, and [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L195) now discovers a Knop as weaveable when its inventory already has history but its attached catalog does not. The shared page seam in [pages.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L15) now renders current `ReferenceCatalog` pages, so `alice/_knop/_references/index.html` gets the current `#reference001` anchor while the planner creates the first catalog history and advances only `alice/_knop/_inventory` to `_s0002`; `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` stays unchanged.

Added coverage in [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L132), [pages_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts#L38), [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/weave_test.ts#L118), and [weave_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts#L32), and updated the task/spec/overview/decision notes without renaming the task note.

Verified with `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/weave/weave_test.ts src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts` and `git diff --check`. I did not run the full repo test suite.

- add unit, integration, and black-box CLI coverage for the settled 09-alice-bio-referenced-woven transition
- extend local weave planning and runtime candidate loading to support first ReferenceCatalog weaving on an already-versioned Knop surface
- version alice/_knop/_references into _history001/_s0001 and advance alice/_knop/_inventory to _s0002 while keeping _mesh/_inventory unchanged
- extend the shared page-rendering seam to cover current and historical ReferenceCatalog pages, including the current #reference001 anchor
- update the weave behavior note, codebase overview, decision log, and task note checklist for the carried 08 -> 09 slice
```

Any learnings you can apply to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] ?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2233_38

I’m checking the `10-alice-bio-updated` task note against what the `09` implementation exposed in practice, then I’ll patch the note only where the new constraints are real and actionable.

There are a few concrete lessons from `09` worth baking into the `10` note, not just hand-waving: treat the already-versioned payload surface as normal input, explicitly freeze the newly generated catalog pages, and move the manifest-backed CLI test earlier in the TDD loop. I’m patching those into the task note now.

Yes. I applied a few concrete `09` learnings directly to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]:

- clarified that `payload.update` must treat the already-versioned `alice/bio` payload surface as normal input, not as an unsupported “already woven” shape
- made the frozen `09` outputs explicit non-targets, including `alice/_knop/_references/index.html`, `alice/_knop/_references/_history001/...`, and `alice/bio/index.html`
- pulled the manifest-backed black-box CLI test earlier in the TDD loop, alongside failing integration coverage, since that caught the real `09` shape issue quickly
- tightened the note so the operation is clearly “update only the working payload bytes, do not route through page generation”

I didn’t run tests because this was a task-note-only edit.

# User_2026-04-04_2236_09

can we just proceed, same chat, same branch?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2236_17

Yes. Same chat and same branch are fine.

This next slice is a direct continuation of the one we just carried, so there’s no technical need to split context. The only real reason to stop would be if you want a separate commit/review boundary first. Otherwise I can continue straight into [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] on the current branch.

I’m continuing directly into `[[wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]`. First step is to inspect the settled `09 -> 10` fixture, the existing `integrate`/`knop add-reference` patterns, and whether a `payload.update` spec or code stub already exists before I add failing tests.

The fixture is cleaner than `09`: only `alice-bio.ttl` changes, and the manifest already nails the machine-facing name as `payload.update`. I’m inspecting the current `integrate` and `knop add-reference` implementations now so I can reuse their request/runtime split and choose a CLI spelling that is consistent instead of inventing a one-off.

There’s no existing `payload.update` implementation or spec stub, but the framework already fixes the operationId. I’m looking for any existing naming precedent for the CLI surface now; if there isn’t one, I’ll keep it conservative and mirror `integrate`’s “source first, designator explicit” pattern rather than guessing something broader.

I don’t see any prior CLI precedent for `payload.update`, so I’m going with the least surprising shape: `weave payload update <path-or-file-url> [designatorPath]`, with `--designator-path` as the explicit form, matching the first carried `integrate` CLI rather than forcing a new source-last exception. Before code, I’m drafting the dedicated `wd.spec.*` note the task calls for, then I’ll lock behavior with failing integration and e2e tests.

The structure is flat and consistent enough to add `src/core/payload/update.ts` and `src/runtime/payload/update.ts` cleanly. I’m drafting the behavior spec note now, then I’ll add failing `10` integration and CLI tests plus the new payload modules in the same shape as `integrate`.

I found the main design tension before writing code: if `payload.update` uses the same “source must already be inside the workspace” rule as `integrate`, the operation either becomes a no-op on the target file or requires extra staging files that would violate the `10` fixture. I’m checking the prior conversation notes for that exact point rather than papering over it.

I found the strongest concrete constraint for `payload.update`: unlike `integrate`, the replacement source should not be forced to live inside the workspace, because the operation’s whole point is to overwrite an already-known working file without leaving extra staging artifacts behind. I’m encoding that explicitly in the new behavior spec and then implementing the runtime to stage bytes from a local path or `file:` URL into the existing working payload file atomically.

I’m writing the dedicated `payload.update` behavior note now. The key design call in it is explicit: local runtime may stage replacement bytes from a local path or `file:` URL outside the workspace, because the target working file is already part of the mesh and only that file should change in `10`.

The spec note is in. I’m adding the first failing `10` tests now, and I’m deliberately using an external replacement source in both harnesses so the runtime contract is forced to preserve the “only `alice-bio.ttl` changes” invariant.

The first `10` tests are in. I’m running only those new suites now to capture the failure mode before implementation; at this point a missing module or command is the expected result.

I’m editing the code now. The implementation is split the same way as `integrate`: `core` plans from `designatorPath + resolved working file path + replacement bytes`, and `runtime` handles local source resolution plus the atomic overwrite of the existing working payload file.

The core planner is in. I’m patching the runtime and CLI now: resolve the existing working payload from `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl`, stage replacement bytes from a local source, and expose the command as `weave payload update ...`.

The command wiring is in. I’m running the new payload-update unit, integration, and CLI suites now; if anything still fails, it should be on the actual behavior, not missing files or command routes.

The first payload-update path is already green, which means the remaining decision is documentation scope, not implementation. I’m checking the framework contract next: if `payload.update` is still absent from `JobKind` and the Alice Bio API examples, I’m going to add the same thin public-example treatment we gave `integrate` instead of leaving the new carried operation undocumented.

The framework side does need one real update: `payload.update` still isn’t in the public `JobKind` enum, so the carried operation would exist in code and conformance but not in the thin API contract. I’m patching the minimal framework pieces now: enum plus one request and one succeeded-job example, nothing broader.

The new local slice is green, so I’m doing the minimum framework follow-through now: add `payload.update` to the thin job contract and add one request and one succeeded-job example so the public example set doesn’t lag behind the carried operation.

The implementation is done. I’m on the close-out doc/accounting pass now: mark the task note progress, add the carried `payload.update` slice to the codebase overview, and log the design decision that this local runtime stages replacement bytes into an already-known working payload file.

Continuing into the `09 -> 10` payload slice. I’m checking the current worktree and the task/overview/decision notes now, then I’ll patch the remaining docs, run targeted verification, and close it out on this branch.

The implementation is already in place; I’m wiring the remaining notes around the actual behavior now. After that I’ll run `deno fmt` on the touched TypeScript files, rerun the payload-focused suites, and check the diff for whitespace issues.

I have the note deltas scoped now. I’m updating the task checklist to reflect the implemented payload slice, then tightening the overview and decision log so they describe the actual `09 -> 10` boundary and the source-staging choice.

The repo notes are patched. I’m checking whether the framework/example changes landed in the nested `semantic-flow-framework` checkout as expected before I run formatting and the focused payload suites.

Formatting is clean. I also confirmed the thin API/example changes are sitting in the nested `semantic-flow-framework` checkout, so I’m verifying both repos now: payload-focused Deno tests in `weave`, plus whitespace checks in `weave` and the framework checkout.

The broader integration and e2e suite is running now, including the existing `integrate`, `knop`, and `weave` paths. That matters here because the CLI parser and shared exports changed, not just the new payload entry point.

The verification run came back clean: 27 tests passed across the full integration and e2e surface, and both repos are whitespace-clean. I’m pulling exact file locations now so the close-out is precise and concise.

I’ve got the main repo locations. I’m grabbing the exact framework file locations too so I can call out that those API/example changes are in the nested checkout, not this repo’s git history.

The core work is complete. I’m getting a quick diff summary for both checkouts so the close-out reflects scope accurately and calls out the separate framework worktree.

Implemented the `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven -> 10-alice-bio-updated` slice on this branch. The core plan is in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update.ts#L5), the local runtime path is in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts#L48) and [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts#L253), and the CLI surface is in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts#L132) and [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts#L412). This path updates only the existing working payload file for `alice/bio`, accepts a local path or `file:` source for staging, validates Turtle before commit, and leaves inventories, history, and generated pages unchanged.

Coverage and notes are in [payload_update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts#L10), [payload_update_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/payload_update_cli_test.ts#L18), [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-payload-update-behavior#L21]], [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload#L124]], [[wd.codebase-overview#L13]], and [[wd.decision-log#L180]]. Thin contract/example updates are also sitting in the nested framework checkout at [semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml#L246), [[sf.api.examples#L26]], [payload-update-job-request.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/payload-update-job-request.jsonld#L1), and [payload-update-job-succeeded.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/payload-update-job-succeeded.jsonld#L1).

Verified with `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/payload/update_test.ts tests/integration tests/e2e` (`27 passed`) and `git diff --check` in both `weave` and the nested `semantic-flow-framework` checkout. I did not run any framework-specific test suite.

From the previous slice, from coderabbit:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

Inline comments:
In `@src/core/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 394-449: The planFirstReferenceCatalogWeave currently hardcodes
"/_references/.../references.ttl" instead of using
referenceCatalogArtifact.workingFilePath, so update
planFirstReferenceCatalogWeave to preserve
referenceCatalogArtifact.workingFilePath: compute
referenceCatalogWorkingFilePath from referenceCatalogArtifact.workingFilePath
and use it when building referenceCatalogPath and the createdFiles history
snapshot path and when calling
renderFirstReferenceCatalogWovenKnopInventoryTurtle (or extend that function to
accept the working file path so it can render hasWorkingLocatedFile and history
manifestation paths correctly). Also either adjust
assertCurrentKnopInventoryShapeForFirstReferenceCatalogWeave to reject
unsupported workingFilePath values or ensure the new code supports
non-"references.ttl" names so the inventory and created files point at the
actual working file path.

In `@src/runtime/weave/pages.ts`:
- Around line 51-53: Dynamic values interpolated into the HTML
(page.currentLinks -> currentLinks string, specifically link.fragment,
link.referenceRoleLabel, and link.referenceTargetPath) are not escaped, allowing
markup breakage or XSS; fix by HTML-escaping all interpolated values before
building the string (introduce or reuse an escapeHtml utility and apply it to
link.fragment for the id and display, and to link.referenceRoleLabel and
link.referenceTargetPath for the text/code content), and apply the same escaping
to the other similar block referenced at lines 64-66 so all dynamic HTML
fragments are safely encoded.

---

Outside diff comments:
In `@src/runtime/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 230-250: The code eagerly calls loadPayloadWorkingArtifact and
loadReferenceCatalogWorkingArtifact before checking eligibility, causing
failures for already-settled or non-requested knops; update
loadWeaveableKnopCandidates so you first build a minimal candidate containing
designatorPath, currentKnopMetadataTurtle and currentKnopInventoryTurtle, call
isWeaveableKnopCandidate(candidate) and only if it returns true then call
loadPayloadWorkingArtifact(...) and loadReferenceCatalogWorkingArtifact(...) to
attach payloadArtifact and referenceCatalogArtifact before pushing the
candidate.

---

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts`:
- Around line 36-74: Add a new Deno.test in pages_test.ts that calls
renderResourcePage (same pattern as the existing "renderResourcePage renders
current ReferenceCatalog pages with fragment anchors" test) but uses a
currentLinks entry whose fragment, referenceRoleLabel, and referenceTargetPath
contain special HTML characters (e.g., &, <, >, "). Assert the produced HTML
contains the properly escaped entities (e.g., &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &quot;) in the
rendered list item and id attribute where appropriate to lock in escaping
behavior for renderResourcePage.

In `@src/runtime/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 368-401: The predicate in isWeaveableKnopCandidate duplicates the
slice/marker detection and precedence logic found in classifyWeaveSlice; extract
the shared detection logic into a single exported utility (e.g.,
isWeaveableSlice or hasWeaveMarkers) that accepts the same inputs used here
(candidate.currentKnopInventoryTurtle and candidate.designatorPath or
equivalent), then replace the body of isWeaveableKnopCandidate and the logic
inside classifyWeaveSlice to call that new shared function; ensure the new
utility returns the same boolean semantics (check referenceCatalogRelationship,
payloadRelationship, and knopInventoryHasHistory) and still uses
referenceCatalogArtifact/payloadArtifact presence checks via the candidate
inputs.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2251_22

I’m checking each CodeRabbit comment against the current `weave` implementation first, then I’ll patch only the ones that still hold and rerun the targeted weave/page tests.

I’ve confirmed at least two of the comments are real on current code: the ReferenceCatalog weave path still hardcodes `references.ttl`, and the page renderer still interpolates unescaped dynamic HTML. I’m checking the runtime candidate-loading complaint and the duplicated slice-detection logic next before I touch code.

The ReferenceCatalog hardcoding is broader than just one path literal: the inventory renderer also bakes in `references.ttl` and the `references-ttl` manifestation directory. I’m tracing the existing payload helper patterns now so I can fix that generically instead of papering over one call site.

The runtime candidate-loading comment still looks valid: the loader resolves working artifacts for every discovered Knop before request filtering or eligibility classification, so an unrelated settled Knop can still fail the whole weave. I’m looking for the smallest test seam to prove that without bloating the slice.

I’ve confirmed three substantive issues and one maintainability fix worth taking now. I’m patching `core` to preserve ReferenceCatalog working file names, patching the page renderer to escape dynamic HTML, and tightening runtime candidate discovery so unrelated or settled Knops don’t block a weave request.

I’m adding two integration checks here rather than one: one locks in the “ignore settled broken Knops” behavior, and the other locks in request scoping so a broken non-requested candidate can’t poison a targeted weave.

The core/runtime/test edits are in. I’m doing a quick static pass over the new call sites now for signature mismatches before I format and run the weave-focused suites.

The weave suite is running. `git diff --check` tripped on an unrelated preexisting trailing-space hunk in [[AGENTS]]; I’m leaving that alone unless you want it cleaned, since it isn’t part of this fix set.

The failing weave tests narrowed this down cleanly: the new ReferenceCatalog helper is right, but I rooted the manifestation segment at the catalog path instead of the historical-state path. I’m correcting that and rerunning the same focused suite.

The weave-specific suite is green now. I’m doing a scoped whitespace check on just the files touched for this follow-up, because the repo still has an unrelated trailing-space change in `AGENTS.md`.

All five CodeRabbit comments held on the current code, and I fixed them.

The ReferenceCatalog weave path now preserves the actual working file path instead of hardcoding `references.ttl`, including the history snapshot path, inventory rendering, and manifestation page path in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts#L407). I also extracted shared slice detection into `detectPendingWeaveSlice` in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts#L196), then used it in runtime candidate discovery so settled or non-requested Knops are skipped before any working-artifact load can fail in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L57) and [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L197).

The ReferenceCatalog page renderer now HTML-escapes dynamic content in [pages.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L15). I added lock-in coverage for the non-default ReferenceCatalog working file path in [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L319), for HTML escaping in [pages_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts#L76), and for ignoring broken settled and non-requested candidates in [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/weave_test.ts#L210).

Verified with `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/weave/weave_test.ts src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts` (`17 passed`) and a scoped `git diff --check` over the touched files. A full `git diff --check` still reports an unrelated trailing-space change in [[AGENTS]], which I left alone.

# User_2026-04-04_2257_06

fix lint error

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2257_15

I’m reproducing the current lint failure first so I fix the real issue rather than guessing from the earlier whitespace check. After that I’ll patch the minimal file set and rerun lint.

The current lint failure is not `AGENTS.md`; it’s a real TypeScript lint violation in [update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update_test.ts) where a test callback is marked `async` without awaiting anything. I’m removing only that unnecessary `async`, then I’ll rerun lint.

Fixed the lint error in [update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update_test.ts#L32) by removing an unnecessary `async` from a synchronous test callback.

Verified with `deno task lint`, which now passes. The trailing whitespace in [[AGENTS]] is still unrelated to Deno lint.

# User_2026-04-04_2259_21

what about these? 

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

- Line 32: The Deno.test declaration named "planPayloadUpdate rejects an
inventory that does not resolve the woven payload artifact" currently declares
its callback as async but contains no await (triggers require-await); remove the
unnecessary async modifier from the test callback so the function is a plain
synchronous function, keeping the test body unchanged and rerunning lint/tests
to confirm the require-await error is resolved.

In `@src/runtime/payload/update.ts`:
- Around line 170-174: The message returned by describePayloadUpdateResult
should remove the redundant "replacing" vs "updating" phrasing and correctly
pluralize "file"/"files" based on updatedPaths.length; update the function
(describePayloadUpdateResult) to build a single clear sentence using
result.payloadArtifactIri and result.workingFilePath, e.g. "Updated payload
<iri> by replacing working file <path> (updated N path(s))." but implement
proper plural logic using result.updatedPaths.length to select "file" vs "files"
and/or "path" vs "paths" so the grammar is correct.

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/cli/run.ts`:
- Around line 412-440: Extract the duplicated logic in
resolvePayloadUpdateDesignatorPath and resolveIntegrateDesignatorPath into a
single helper (e.g., resolveDesignatorPath(options: { designatorPath?: string },
designatorPathArg?: string): string) and replace both implementations to call
this helper; ensure the helper preserves current behavior and throws
PayloadUpdateInputError (or a shared error type) with the same messages used by
resolvePayloadUpdateDesignatorPath and resolveIntegrateDesignatorPath so callers
see identical validation and error text, and update references to the original
functions to use the new helper internally.

In `@src/core/payload/update.ts`:
- Around line 1-3: The duplicated constant reservedDesignatorSegments (used in
update.ts and another runtime update.ts) should be extracted into a single
exported constant in a shared module (e.g., create and export
RESERVED_DESIGNATOR_SEGMENTS from a new/shared constants file) and both
update.ts files should import that exported symbol instead of defining their own
Set; update the references to use the shared RESERVED_DESIGNATOR_SEGMENTS (or
the chosen exported name) so the set is maintained in one place while preserving
existing dependency boundaries.
- Around line 166-187: The current assertCurrentPayloadArtifactShape uses
brittle string matching (currentKnopInventoryTurtle.includes on
requiredFragments) which can fail for equivalent RDF with different
whitespace/order/prefixes; replace the string-based checks in
assertCurrentPayloadArtifactShape with a semantic RDF check by parsing
currentKnopInventoryTurtle using an RDF parser (e.g., N3.Parser), convert
triples/quads into a set you can query, and then verify the expected
triples/properties (the knop resource a sflo:Knop, sflo:hasPayloadArtifact
linking to the designatorPath, the designatorPath typed as
sflo:PayloadArtifact/sflo:DigitalArtifact/sflo:RdfDocument,
sflo:hasWorkingLocatedFile linking to workingFilePath, and
sflo:currentArtifactHistory pointing at designatorPath/_history001) using triple
membership tests against the parsed graph; keep the same PayloadUpdateInputError
behavior when any required triple is missing and continue to reference the same
function name and variables (currentKnopInventoryTurtle, designatorPath,
workingFilePath, requiredFragments) to locate where to implement the
parser-based checks.

In `@src/runtime/payload/update.ts`:
- Around line 433-450: applyPayloadUpdateAtomically currently assumes exactly
one file by using plan.updatedFiles[0] without checks; add a defensive check at
the start of applyPayloadUpdateAtomically to validate plan.updatedFiles.length
=== 1 (or handle multiple files), and if the assertion fails throw a clear Error
(or iterate and process each file consistently), so that the subsequent creation
of stagedPayloadUpdate (absolutePath, tempPath, backupPath) is only done when a
valid single-file invariant holds or is adapted to multi-file behavior.
- Around line 396-413: The function assertUpdatedTargetsExist currently uses
synchronous Deno.statSync; change it to an async function (export or function
signature: async function assertUpdatedTargetsExist(...): Promise<void>) and
replace Deno.statSync(absolutePath) with await Deno.stat(absolutePath) inside a
try/catch, preserving the same NotFound handling (if (error instanceof
Deno.errors.NotFound) throw new PayloadUpdateRuntimeError(...); else rethrow).
Finally update every call site (the caller that invoked
assertUpdatedTargetsExist) to await the function so it returns a Promise and the
control flow remains correct.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2259_26

I’m checking each of those follow-up comments against the current payload code now. If a comment still holds, I’ll patch it; if not, I’ll call out why it’s already satisfied or not worth taking in this slice.

I’ve checked the payload comments against current code. One is already done, one is a real user-facing wording bug, and the rest are low-risk cleanups except the RDF-shape check, which I’m only taking if it stays within the current narrow “settled woven payload shape” boundary.

I’m taking the small cleanups and the wording fix. For the parser-based core check, I’m doing one quick sanity check on how `n3` resolves relative IRIs so I don’t overfit the implementation to one serialization shape.

I’ve confirmed the `async` test comment is already resolved. I’m patching the remaining valid ones now: better payload CLI/result wording, shared designator-segment constant, async target checks plus the single-file guard, the shared CLI helper, and a parser-backed core shape check with a unit test that proves it handles equivalent RDF ordering.

# User_2026-04-04_2301_32

we do have a future task related to rdf, [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] if that helps.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_2301_39

That helps. I’m reading the RDF parsing task note now before I touch the parser-backed payload check, because that’s the one comment most likely to overlap future refactoring rather than fix a present defect.

The RDF task note is useful here: it argues against turning this into broad parser cleanup, but it does not block a localized semantic check in `payload.update` itself. I’m keeping that change narrowly scoped to the touched function and test, and I’m not expanding into the broader runtime RDF-read debt called out in the task note.

One patch chunk missed current line offsets in `runtime/payload/update.ts`. I’m re-reading the exact sections and applying that file in a narrower patch so I don’t clobber unrelated edits.

The payload patches are in. I’m formatting the touched files and running payload-focused tests plus lint next so we can separate real follow-up fixes from speculative cleanup.

Lint is clean. The payload suite is still running, including the CLI path, so I’m waiting on that before I call any of these comments resolved.

The payload suite surfaced one real type-check issue from the new parser-backed helper: `quad` needs an explicit type annotation. I’m fixing that and rerunning the same payload-focused test set.

The payload path is green. Because I changed the shared CLI designator-path resolver, I’m running the integrate CLI acceptance too, then I’ll do a scoped whitespace check and summarize which review comments actually held.

Using [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] as a boundary was useful. I treated the broad RDF-parser migration as future work, but still took the localized `payload.update` parser fix because that file was already under review and the change stayed narrow.

Status of the comments:
- The `async` callback in [update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update_test.ts) was already fixed before this pass.
- The awkward `describePayloadUpdateResult` wording was valid and is fixed in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts).
- The duplicated CLI designator-path logic was valid and is now shared in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts).
- The duplicated reserved designator set between the two payload files was valid and is now shared via [designator_segments.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/designator_segments.ts).
- The brittle string-based payload shape check was valid enough to fix locally, and [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update.ts) now uses parsed RDF quad membership instead of `includes`, with a semantic-equivalence test added in [update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/payload/update_test.ts).
- The single-file assumption in `applyPayloadUpdateAtomically` was valid and now has an explicit guard in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts).
- The sync `Deno.statSync` target check was valid and is now async in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts).

I did not broaden the reserved-segment cleanup to the other duplicated modules yet; that would be a separate cleanup pass.

Verified with:
- `deno task lint`
- `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/payload/update_test.ts src/runtime/payload/update_test.ts tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts tests/e2e/payload_update_cli_test.ts`

fix(payload): tighten local payload update validation and CLI seams

- improve payload update result wording with correct singular/plural grammar
- share CLI designator-path resolution between integrate and payload update
- move payload reserved designator segments into a shared core constant
- replace payload.update woven-shape string matching with parser-backed quad checks
- make payload target existence checks async and guard the single-file atomic update invariant
- add unit coverage for semantic-equivalent payload inventory parsing and result message grammar

# User_2026-04-05_0817_07

OK, ready for [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] ? New chat or continue in this one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0817_17

Yes. Same chat is fine.

This payload task is already implemented on the current branch, and the follow-up review fixes are in as well, so continuing here keeps the best context. A new chat would only help if you want a cleaner transcript or a fresh review boundary; it is not technically necessary.

# User_2026-04-05_0817_55

codecov: 73.60% of diff hit (target 79.10%) -- any valuable coverage we could add?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0818_06

I’m checking the current diff and the touched tests first, then I’ll identify which changed branches are still uncovered and whether there’s a worthwhile small test to add rather than padding coverage.

The worktree is clean, so I’m looking at the branch diff rather than uncommitted files. Next I’m finding the merge base and the changed files that Codecov is likely scoring.

There are a couple of genuinely useful gaps left, not just Codecov padding. I’m checking the existing CLI/error-test patterns so I can add the highest-signal ones instead of inventing a new test style.

There are three high-signal additions left that look worth doing: one `file:` source-path integration test, one “invalid Turtle leaves the working file untouched” integration test, and a CLI validation test for the shared designator-path helper. I’m adding those rather than chasing internal guards that the public API can’t realistically hit.

I’m adding one more CLI check for the “missing designator path” branch too. That’s still user-facing behavior in the shared resolver, and it’s cheap coverage with real value.

The added tests are all public-behavior tests, not internals. I’m formatting them and running the payload-focused suites plus lint now.

Lint is still clean. The payload test bundle is running now; that includes the new CLI validation cases and the `file:` URL / invalid-RDF runtime paths.

Yes. I added coverage that looks worth keeping, not just padding.

The new tests are in [payload_update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts) and [payload_update_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/payload_update_cli_test.ts). They cover:
- `file:` URL payload sources, which the runtime explicitly supports in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts)
- invalid Turtle replacement input, with an assertion that the working payload file is left unchanged
- CLI rejection for conflicting designator paths
- CLI rejection when the designator path is missing, and confirmation that logging/execution never starts

I verified with `deno task lint` and the payload-focused test bundle; all passed. I have not recomputed Codecov locally, but these should hit real uncovered branches in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts) and [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts).

If the PR is still short after that, the next worthwhile test would be one `integrate` CLI validation case for the shared designator-path helper in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts). After that, most remaining uncovered lines are defensive invariants with much lower ROI.

# User_2026-04-05_0845_37

Here's some more coderabbit comments. Implement those you see as valid and worthwhile:

In `@src/core/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 517-536: The function
assertCurrentMeshInventoryShapeForFirstReferenceCatalogWeave currently hardcodes
two designator paths ("<alice/_knop>" and "<alice/bio/_knop>") which couples the
validation to the 08-alice-bio fixture; update this function to either (A)
accept the expected knop designators as parameters (e.g., pass an array of
required designator prefixes into
assertCurrentMeshInventoryShapeForFirstReferenceCatalogWeave) and check for
those parameterized fragments instead of literal "<alice/_knop>" and
"<alice/bio/_knop>", or (B) remove the two specific knop fragments from
requiredFragments and replace them with a more general check (e.g., assert
presence of any "a sflo:Knop" triple or a regex like /<[^>]+> a sflo:Knop/
against currentMeshInventoryTurtle) so the precondition is not tied to the alice
fixture; update callers accordingly to provide expected designators when needed.

In `@src/runtime/payload/update.ts`:
- Around line 292-311: resolveSourcePath currently sends every source string
through tryParseUrl which misclassifies Windows paths and colon-containing
filenames as URLs; change the logic to only treat inputs that explicitly start
with "file:" as URLs (parse them with fromFileUrl/new URL), detect and reject
obvious remote schemes of the form "<scheme>://" by throwing the same
PayloadUpdateRuntimeError for non-file protocols, and otherwise treat the input
as a filesystem path (using isAbsolute/resolve with workspaceRoot). Update or
remove tryParseUrl usage accordingly so resolveSourcePath no longer parses
generic strings through URL constructor.

---

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/core/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 137-141: The switch over classifyWeaveSlice results (handling
firstKnopWeave, firstPayloadWeave, firstReferenceCatalogWeave) is treated as
exhaustive but TypeScript may still consider an undefined return path; make the
control flow explicit by either changing classifyWeaveSlice to throw on
unsupported slices or adding a default branch to the switch that throws the
WeaveInputError; locate the switch that consumes classifyWeaveSlice and either
update classifyWeaveSlice to throw for unsupported candidates or add an explicit
default case that throws the existing WeaveInputError (the throw new
WeaveInputError(...) statement) so there is no unreachable/implicit code path.

In `@src/runtime/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 238-274: You are calling detectPendingWeaveSlice twice for each
candidate; compute the slice once (as you already do into variable slice) and
thread it through instead of re-parsing inside isWeaveableKnopCandidate. Update
isWeaveableKnopCandidate to accept the precomputed slice (e.g., add a parameter
like candidateSlice) or create a new helper (e.g.,
isWeaveableKnopCandidateWithSlice) and adjust callers here so you use the
existing slice to decide whether to load payload/reference via
loadPayloadWorkingArtifact/loadReferenceCatalogWorkingArtifact and to validate
the candidate before pushing to candidates.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0845_45

I’m checking those three areas directly first: the reference-catalog mesh inventory assertion, the payload source-path resolver, and the repeated slice detection in weave runtime. Then I’ll patch only the ones that still hold and rerun the focused suites.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0847_01

I’ve confirmed three worthwhile changes: generalize the reference-catalog mesh assertion off the hardcoded Alice paths, stop parsing arbitrary payload sources as URLs, and stop re-detecting the same weave slice in runtime candidate loading. I’m patching those now and adding one payload source-path test plus one non-Alice weave test to lock them in.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0847_22

The payload source-path patch left a duplicated tail from the old implementation. I’m cleaning that up before touching anything else.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_22

The edits are in. I’m formatting the touched files and running the focused weave and payload suites now so we can see whether any of these comments exposed real regressions or just cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_25

Lint found one leftover helper from the old payload source-path implementation. I’m deleting that dead function and rerunning lint while the test suite finishes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_38

Lint is clean again. The combined weave/payload suite is still running; I’m waiting for that before I summarize which comments landed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0848_43

The generalized mesh-inventory assertion exposed a small ordering bug in `planFirstReferenceCatalogWeave`: I passed `designatorPath` before it was declared. I’m fixing that now and rerunning the same focused suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0849_09

The focused weave and payload suites are green now. I’m doing a final scoped whitespace check and grabbing the touched file list so the close-out is precise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0849_25

I took four of the comments.

Applied:
- Generalized the reference-catalog mesh precondition so it no longer hardcodes `alice` and `alice/bio`; [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts#L414) now checks the current candidate’s Knop path instead, and [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L368) locks that in with a non-Alice case.
- Fixed payload source resolution in [update.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/payload/update.ts#L292) so only explicit `file:` inputs are parsed as URLs, remote `scheme://` sources are rejected, and colon-containing filenames stay filesystem paths. Coverage is in [payload_update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts#L105) and [payload_update_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts#L138).
- Added the explicit `default` branch in the `classifyWeaveSlice` consumer switch in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts#L117).
- Stopped recomputing `detectPendingWeaveSlice` in runtime weave candidate loading; [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L243) now computes it once and threads it into [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L392).

I skipped the rest because there wasn’t anything else in that set worth changing beyond those fixes.

Verified with:
- `deno task lint`
- `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts src/core/payload/update_test.ts src/runtime/payload/update_test.ts tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts tests/e2e/payload_update_cli_test.ts`

fix(weave): generalize reference-catalog checks and tighten source loading

- remove alice-specific mesh-inventory assumptions from the first reference-catalog weave precondition
- reuse the detected weave slice during runtime candidate loading instead of recomputing it
- treat only explicit file: inputs as URL sources for payload update and reject remote schemes
- keep colon-containing payload source filenames on the filesystem-path path
- add focused weave and payload coverage for non-alice reference-catalog weaving and payload source resolution edge cases
```

# User_2026-04-05_0852_19

codecov is still  77.34% of diff hit (target 79.10%). Maybe add the "integrate cli validation case"?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0852_31

Yes. That’s the next highest-value coverage add: small, public-behavior tests on `integrate` that exercise the shared designator-path helper through the integrate-specific error path, not through `payload update`.

I’m adding focused `integrate` CLI rejection tests for conflicting and missing designator paths, then I’ll rerun that e2e file plus lint.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0852_48

I have the exact uncovered integrate-specific branches. I’m adding two e2e tests now: one for conflicting positional vs option designator paths, and one for the missing-designator-path case. Both will assert that logging and execution never start.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0853_04

The integrate CLI tests are in. I’m formatting that file and running just the integrate e2e suite plus lint so we get a quick signal on whether this is enough to move diff coverage.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0853_08

Lint is clean. The integrate CLI file is still running, and that will tell us whether the no-logging/no-execution assumptions hold on the actual CLI path.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0853_12

The integrate validation cases passed cleanly. I’m doing a scoped whitespace check and grabbing the exact file reference for the close-out.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0853_17

Yes. I added the integrate CLI validation cases in [integrate_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/integrate_cli_test.ts#L105):

- conflicting positional vs `--designator-path`
- missing designator path entirely

Both assert the integrate-specific error text, plus that `.weave/logs` is not created and the integrate target surface is still absent. That’s the right branch to hit for the shared resolver in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts), because payload already covered the shared helper but not the `IntegrateInputError` path.

Verified with:
- `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run tests/e2e/integrate_cli_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`

I can’t tell you the new Codecov percentage from local tooling here, but this is the most plausible remaining high-value diff-coverage add for the current branch.

# User_2026-04-05_0858_22

Any learnings you can apply to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] ? Ready to go on that?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0858_39

Yes. A few concrete learnings are worth folding into [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]:

- clarify source resolution more explicitly:
  `payload.update` accepts plain local filesystem paths and explicit `file:` URLs, rejects remote `scheme://` sources, and must not misclassify colon-containing filenames as URLs
- add a fail-closed invariant:
  if the replacement Turtle does not parse, the update aborts and leaves the existing working payload file unchanged
- tighten the testing section:
  cover conflicting and missing `designatorPath` CLI inputs, `file:` source handling, remote URL rejection, and invalid-RDF rollback behavior
- keep the RDF note boundary explicit:
  narrow parser-backed validation inside `payload.update` was worth taking, but broader RDF-read cleanup still belongs in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]]

And yes, it’s ready. The payload slice itself is implemented and the follow-up hardening is in. If you want, I can update that task note now to reflect the settled behavior and tests.

# User_2026-04-05_0859_36

OK, update and then implement.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0859_45

I’m updating the payload task note first so it matches the settled behavior we actually proved, then I’ll check whether any implementation gap remains after the follow-up hardening.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0900_43

I’m updating the payload task note to reflect the settled behavior and then I’ll verify whether any code work remains beyond what is already on the branch.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0900_49

I’ve confirmed the code path is already in place; the remaining useful work here is to tighten the task note so it matches the implemented source-handling, validation, and test boundaries.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_07

The note is updated. I’m doing one quick pass against the current diff so I can tell you cleanly whether anything beyond documentation was actually needed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0901_14

Updated [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] to match the settled implementation.

The note now explicitly captures:
- accepted source forms: plain filesystem paths and explicit `file:` URLs
- rejected source forms: remote `scheme://` URLs
- the colon-containing filename edge case
- fail-closed invalid-Turtle behavior
- the extra CLI validation coverage for conflicting or missing `designatorPath`
- the boundary that broader RDF cleanup still belongs in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]]

On the “implement” part: there was no remaining code gap to fill. The `payload.update` slice and the follow-up hardening are already on this branch, so this turn only needed the task-note update.

I did not run tests in this turn because the only new change was documentation.

# User_2026-04-05_0902_13

OK, so new task note for the next slice?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0902_30

Yes.

The clean next step is a new `wd.task.*` note for the next carried slice, not more expansion inside [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]]. That note is now correctly scoped to the non-woven `09 -> 10` payload update.

The next task note should be for the `10-alice-bio-updated -> 11-alice-bio-v2-woven` slice. That keeps the boundary crisp:

- `payload.update` mutates current working payload bytes
- the next `weave` slice versions that payload state and regenerates the woven surface

I would keep the current task note in place and draft a new one for `11`. If you want, I can create that note now.

# User_2026-04-05_0903_21

yes please.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0903_30

I’m drafting the next task note around the `10 -> 11` boundary and will anchor it to the existing fixture/spec language before I add the file.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0903_37

I have the shape of the prior tasks; now I’m pulling the `11` fixture signals so the new note is specific instead of hand-wavy.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0903_47

I’m generating the new note with a fresh timestamp rather than guessing one, so it fits the existing Dendron naming pattern.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0903_57

The `11` manifest widens the surface a bit, so I’m extracting the exact expected file changes before I write the scope bullets.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0904_06

I have enough fixture detail now. I’m creating a focused task note for the second payload weave rather than a generic “next weave” placeholder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0904_15

I’m keeping this as a task note only. No code or overview churn yet unless you ask for it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0904_36

The `11` task is not just “second history state.” The manifest expects broader page regeneration, so I’m baking that into the note rather than under-scoping it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0904_51

I’m writing the note with the actual `11` fixture constraints, including the broader HTML regeneration surface, so it does not understate the slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0905_26

The note is in place. I’m doing a quick sanity read so I can call out scope accurately and not hand you a malformed task file.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0905_31

Created [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven]].

The note scopes the next carried slice as `10-alice-bio-updated -> 11-alice-bio-v2-woven`, centered on:
- creating `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002/...`
- advancing `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory` to `_s0002`
- keeping `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` unchanged
- regenerating the broader `11` HTML surface, including current and historical `alice/bio` pages and the affected history landing pages

I did not run tests because this turn only added documentation. Current uncommitted note-related files are the updated [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] and the new `11` task note.

# User_2026-04-05_0905_54

by "broader HTML regeneration surface", do you mean HTML content changes? If so, I wouldn't worry about that too much. For now we really only care that the ResourcePages get created, not what their content is.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0906_07

I mean “more page files are expected to exist or be regenerated,” not “we should spend time enriching page copy or layout.” I’m tightening the new task note to reflect that distinction explicitly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0906_21

I tightened the note language. One small pass to catch wording issues, then I’ll answer the design point directly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0906_24

One typo in the note; fixing that and then I’ll answer the acceptance-boundary part plainly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0906_31

Yes. I meant “more HTML files are in scope,” not “we should invest in better page content.”

For this slice, the right interpretation is:
- care that the required ResourcePages exist at the expected paths
- keep page content minimal and fixture-driven
- do not treat `11` as a renderer-design task

I updated [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven]] to say that explicitly.

One caveat: if we keep the current `11` Accord manifest as the black-box acceptance layer, HTML still matters somewhat because those file expectations are `compareMode: "text"`, not just existence checks. So I agree with your product priority, but the acceptance harness may still force fixture-text matching unless we deliberately relax that later. I did not change that contract here.

# User_2026-04-05_0907_31

OK, ready to implement? New chat or continue in this one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0907_38

Yes. Same chat is better.

The `11` task note is now scoped tightly enough to implement, and this thread already has the relevant context from `09`, `10`, the payload hardening, and the `11` fixture expectations. A new chat would mostly just throw away context.

Only caveat: the branch currently has uncommitted note changes in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_2019-update-alice-bio-payload]] and [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven]]. That is not a blocker unless you want a clean commit boundary first.

If you want, I can start the `10 -> 11` implementation now in this chat.

# User_2026-04-05_0907_53

yes, start implementation

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_02

I’m starting the `10 -> 11` weave slice by checking the current `weave` core/runtime seams against the `11-alice-bio-v2-woven` manifest and the existing `09`/`10` tests, then I’ll add failing integration and CLI coverage before touching implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_08

I’ve confirmed the current `weave` path only knows the first Knop, first payload, and first ReferenceCatalog slices. Next I’m mapping the exact `11` gap in core planning, runtime candidate loading, and the page model tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_18

I need the exact `11` page/file delta now, because the implementation risk is mostly in what we create, not in the CLI surface. I’m comparing the current page-builder outputs with the fixture files next.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_25

I’ve got the current builder shapes. Now I’m pulling the actual `10 -> 11` fixture diff so I can make the failing tests precise instead of guessing which pages or inventory fields need to advance.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_39

The main implementation gap is clearer now: `11` is not just a new payload snapshot. The current runtime only creates new pages, but the fixture expects existing ResourcePages to be updated too. I’m checking how much page content actually changed before I decide whether to add a small “updated pages” seam or something broader.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0908_53

The fixture change is bigger than a mere file-exists check: `11` introduces richer generic history pages and slightly richer identifier pages. I’m sampling one file from each class now so I can decide whether to extend the current renderer generically or keep it as a narrow `11`-specific layer.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0909_50

I can keep the earlier slices stable if I scope the richer rendering to `11` only. I’m pulling the remaining page templates now to see whether they collapse into a few generic models or whether I should deliberately weaken the `11` HTML assertions instead.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0909_57

Plan for the `11` slice:

1. Add failing coverage for the new payload-history weave and the page-file behavior we actually want to preserve.
2. Extend `core/weave` to recognize and plan a second payload-state weave, including `_s0002` payload history and `_s0002` payload KnopInventory.
3. Extend runtime execution so `weave` can update existing ResourcePages as well as create new ones.
4. Decide the HTML boundary pragmatically:
   - keep the new state/manifests/pages present
   - avoid broad renderer churn unless the failing tests show it is required
5. Run the focused weave suites and then update notes only if the implementation boundary moved.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0910_34

I’m taking the narrower route that matches your priority: treat `11` as “new history/materialization surfaces appear” first, not “rewrite every old page to richer prose.” That means the next tests will focus on the new `_s0002` files plus the inventory/history advancement, not on matching all fixture HTML text.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_03

I’ve decided the first implementation pass will honor your stated boundary: make the `11` state and page files appear correctly, and keep HTML-content assertions intentionally light for the new slice. I’m adding failing tests on that basis now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0911_41

The failing coverage is in. I’m running the weave-focused unit, integration, and CLI tests now to expose the exact implementation breakpoints before editing the core/runtime paths.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0912_18

The core change is going in now: a new narrow `secondPayloadWeave` slice with no mesh-inventory rewrite, just `_s0002` payload and payload-KnopInventory history materialization.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0913_25

The core slice is in. I’m wiring runtime discovery so `alice/bio` is actually surfaced as weaveable from the settled `10` workspace instead of being skipped as already woven.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0913_34

I’ve connected runtime candidate loading. Running the same weave suites now to see whether the remaining failures are logic or output-shape issues.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0914_09

The false positive came from `alice/bio` already having `_s0001` in the `08/09` workspace. I’m tightening runtime discovery so the second payload weave is only considered when the current working payload actually differs from the latest historical snapshot.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0914_24

I tightened the candidate gate, but the snapshot-load error path is too brittle as written. I’m cleaning that up before rerunning tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0914_37

The candidate gating is corrected. I’m rerunning the weave suites to check whether we’re down to output-shape or lint issues.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0914_56

The code path is passing the targeted weave suites now. I’m doing the cleanup pass next: lint/format checks, then I’ll update the task note and the high-level overview to reflect the settled `11` boundary we actually implemented.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0915_05

I’m updating the `11` task note and the overview now to reflect the implementation boundary that actually landed: second payload-state weave, new `_s0002` ResourcePages, and intentionally minimal HTML-content expectations for this slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0915_43

I’m making one small spec note update too, because the weave behavior note still claims the carried implementation stops at `09`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0915_58

The slice is implemented. I’m running one consolidated verification pass now: the weave-focused tests plus a diff hygiene check.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_0916_17

Implemented the `10-alice-bio-updated -> 11-alice-bio-v2-woven` slice.

The core change is in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts): `weave` now recognizes a narrow `secondPayloadWeave` slice, creates `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002/...`, advances `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory` to `_s0002`, and keeps `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` unchanged. Runtime candidate loading in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts) now only treats that slice as weaveable when the current working payload actually differs from the latest historical snapshot, which avoids falsely surfacing `alice/bio` during the `08 -> 09` reference-catalog weave.

Coverage is in [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and [weave_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts). I also updated [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven]], [[wd.codebase-overview]], and [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]. For this slice, the `11` black-box CLI test intentionally treats HTML page content as lower priority than page-path materialization, so it checks RDF outputs canonically and HTML presence rather than full text parity.

Verified with `deno task lint`, `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts`, and scoped `git diff --check`. I did not run the full repo test suite.

- add the narrow second payload-state weave path for an already woven payload artifact
- create alice/bio/_history001/_s0002 and advance alice/bio/_knop/_inventory to _s0002 while keeping _mesh/_inventory unchanged
- treat a second payload weave as eligible only when the working payload differs from the latest historical snapshot
- add unit, integration, and black-box CLI coverage for 11-alice-bio-v2-woven
- document the carried 11 slice and update the weave behavior and codebase overview notes

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1002_59

`deno lint` and `deno fmt` enforce different things. I’m formatting the reported files and then rechecking the weave-focused tests so we don’t leave a dirty style-only diff.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1003_04

Formatting is clean. I’m just waiting on the test run to finish so I can confirm nothing shifted semantically.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1003_09

That’s expected: `lint` does not check formatting.

I formatted the two files:
- [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts)
- [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/weave_test.ts)

Then I reran the weave-focused suites:
- `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts`

Result: `18 passed`, and scoped `git diff --check` is clean.

# User_2026-04-05_1003_44

OK, can you create the next task note if we're done with this one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1003_53

I’m drafting the next carried task note for the `11 -> 12` slice and anchoring it to the settled Alice Bio ladder so it stays narrow instead of leaking into the later Bob weave.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1004_02

I have the manifest, but I want the exact `11 -> 12` file boundary before I write the note so it stays as crisp as the earlier slices.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1004_09

There’s no sign of an extract task/spec yet, which matters because `12` is the first carried non-woven extraction slice. I’m confirming that before I add the note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1004_21

I’ve got enough to draft the task note. One last check on the mesh-inventory delta will make the Decisions and Testing sections much sharper.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1004_53

I’m writing the note as the first narrow `extract` slice, not as “Bob creation in general,” and I’m explicitly calling out that manifest-scoped acceptance should ignore the unrelated fixture `README.md` churn.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1005_31

The note is in place. I’m doing a quick sanity read so I can call out any scope choices that might deserve your pushback now rather than during implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1005_39

Created [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob]].

It scopes the next carried slice as `11-alice-bio-v2-woven -> 12-bob-extracted`: update `_mesh/_inventory`, create Bob’s minimal Knop support artifacts, add one `Supplemental` reference back to `alice/bio` pinned to `_s0002`, and keep Bob pages absent until the later weave. I also made the acceptance boundary explicit: the CLI test for this slice should stay manifest-scoped and ignore the unrelated fixture `README.md` churn.

I did not run tests because this turn only added documentation.

# User_2026-04-05_1006_12

ok, this chat or a new one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-05_1006_16

New chat is better now.

This thread already spans `09`, `10`, `11`, several review-fix passes, coverage work, and two new task notes. For `extract`, a fresh thread gives a cleaner boundary and reduces the chance of accidental carryover from the `weave` and `payload.update` assumptions.

You can continue here technically, but I would start a new chat for [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob]].
