knop create

following up from [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create]]

I’m pulling the task context and the repo guidance first, then I’ll trace where `knop create` should fit in the current mesh/bootstrap flow before editing anything.

I have the task notes. Next I’m locating the existing `mesh create` implementation, the Alice fixture files, and the core ontology notes so I can mirror the established pattern instead of inventing a second one.

I’ve confirmed the repo already has a clean `mesh create` vertical slice and a dirty worktree in docs that I’ll leave alone. Now I’m reading the existing core/runtime/CLI/test shape plus the settled Alice fixture so the `knop create` slice lands in the same architecture.

The existing slice is small and direct: pure planning in `src/core`, file materialization in `src/runtime`, and a thin Cliffy CLI. I’m pulling the `03 -> 04` fixture delta now so the new plan produces the exact support artifacts and inventory links the fixture expects.

The fixture delta is narrower than the task note suggests: `knop create` only needs to add two new Knop files and patch `_mesh/_inventory`; it leaves `alice-bio.ttl` and `_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl` alone. I’m checking the current doc edits before I touch any notes so I don’t trample work already in progress.

I’m at the design boundary now. The first CLI should not ask for `meshBase` again for `knop create`; that information already lives in the workspace, so repeating it would make the command easier to misuse. I’m checking whether the notes already constrain `designatorPath` enough to make that validation explicit.

I’ve got the implementation shape pinned down: `knop create` will take only `designatorPath`, resolve `meshBase` from `_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl`, create the two Knop files, and patch `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` in place. I’m editing the core/runtime/CLI and test scaffold now, then I’ll circle back to the task/spec notes with only the minimum doc changes this slice actually needs.

I’m patching the code now. The main moving parts are a pure `knop create` planner, a runtime loader that resolves mesh state from the workspace, and a new black-box fixture materializer so the `03 -> 04` tests exercise the full branch state rather than a hand-built subset.

The first patch didn’t apply cleanly because `src/cli/run.ts` drifted from the context I targeted. I’m reading back the touched files and reapplying in smaller chunks so I don’t introduce a half-merged edit.

No code landed from the failed patch, so I’m reapplying from a clean state in smaller chunks. That keeps the diff easier to verify and avoids a second wide miss.

The code is in place. I’m doing a fast readback before running Deno so I can catch obvious type or CLI-shape mistakes while the diff is still small.

The code reads coherently. I’m formatting and then running `check` plus the test suite so I can catch both the CLI parser surface and the fixture-based runtime behavior before I touch the notes.

The typecheck failure is in the Cliffy command shape, not the operation logic. I’m switching the `knop create` subcommand to the explicit `.arguments(...)` form Cliffy expects, then rerunning the checks.

The implementation is green. I’m doing the minimum documentation and contract pass now: a dedicated `knop create` spec note, task checklist updates, a small decision-log entry, and a thin framework example set only where this slice actually clarifies the request/result shape.

The remaining work is note and contract upkeep, not behavior. I’m keeping that pass narrow: enough to reflect the implemented slice and the one concrete CLI decision, without turning this into a documentation sprawl task.

The code and tests are done. I’m giving the docs/examples a quick sanity pass now, mainly to make sure the new note and JSON-LD examples say exactly what the implementation does and nothing broader.

The Weave repo changes are complete. I’m checking the nested framework repo status now so I can tell you cleanly which edits landed in the main repo and which landed in the sibling dependency workspace.

Implemented the first local `knop create` slice. `weave knop create <designatorPath>` now resolves `meshBase` from the existing mesh metadata, creates the two Knop support artifacts, and updates `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` to register the new Knop. The main code is in [src/core/knop/create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts), [src/runtime/knop/create.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/create.ts), and [src/cli/run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts).

I added unit, integration, and black-box CLI coverage in [src/core/knop/create_test.ts](../../src/core/knop/create_test.ts), [tests/integration/knop_create_test.ts](../../tests/integration/knop_create_test.ts), and [tests/e2e/knop_create_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/knop_create_cli_test.ts), plus a full-branch fixture materializer in [tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts](../../tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts). I also added the slice note [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-knop-create]], updated the task/overview/decision notes, and added thin framework examples in [knop-create-job-request.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/knop-create-job-request.jsonld) and [knop-create-job-succeeded.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/knop-create-job-succeeded.jsonld).

Verified with `deno task check`, `deno task lint`, and `deno task test`. Pre-existing dirty files [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-mesh-create]] and [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-weave-bootstrap-mesh-create]] were left as-is.

I’m checking what changed since the last pass and what’s still open in the task/docs state before I edit anything else.

The code work appears to be out of the worktree now. What’s still pending here is mostly note hygiene: the bootstrap note rename is half-finished, and the `knop create` task note is still a `wd.task.*` even though its checklist is complete.

The remaining cleanup is straightforward: finish the task-note lifecycle properly by renaming `wd.task.2026.2026-04-03-knop-create.md` to `wd.completed.*` and update the note references that still point at the old task names.

I’m applying the note-state cleanup now: renaming the completed `knop create` task note and fixing the decision-log wikilinks that still point at the old task filenames.

The move hunk needs an actual content context, so I’m splitting it: patch the link targets first, then do the note rename cleanly as a file move.

The task-note rename is done. I’m checking for any lingering references to the old task names so the note graph stays consistent.

One stale point remains in the historical architecture note: it still says the post-`mesh create` slice is undecided. I’m correcting that to match what’s actually been carried now.

The note graph is now consistent: both completed task notes are using `wd.completed.*`, the decision log points at the completed notes, and the historical architecture note no longer claims the next slice is undecided.

Finished the note cleanup.

I renamed the completed task note to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-03-knop-create]], updated the completed-task references in [[wd.decision-log]], and corrected the stale “next slice” line in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-20-architecture-planning]].

`git status` now only reflects the two task-note renames plus those note edits. Since the renames are still unstaged, Git shows them as `D` + `??`; `git add -A` will record them as renames. I didn’t rerun tests because this pass only touched notes.

# User_2026-04-04_0720_34

why are we using "knop.create" with the dot? I see knop.addReference with a dot, but that's probably a mistake.  It's probably fine, but we should be consistent.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0720_47

I’m tracing how operation names are currently used in the notes, manifests, and examples so I can answer from the repo rather than from taste.

I found the split: the repo currently uses plain English verb phrases for human-facing prose and CLI, but dotted names for machine-facing job kinds and manifest `operationId` values. I’m checking the API spec wording too, because that’s where the contract boundary is supposed to live.

There isn’t a deep semantic reason for the dot. The practical reason is that the repo is currently using two different naming surfaces:

- human-facing command/prose names: `mesh create`, `knop create`
- machine-facing job kind / manifest operation keys: `mesh.create`, `knop.create`

You can see that split in [[sf.api]], the `JobKind` enum in [semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml), the conformance manifest [04-alice-knop-created.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/04-alice-knop-created.jsonld), and the CLI code in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts).

So `knop.create` itself is not obviously a mistake. It is the machine-token version of `knop create`, the same way `mesh.create` is the machine-token version of `mesh create`.

The real inconsistency is broader:

- some machine names are dotted: `mesh.create`, `knop.create`, `knop.addReference`, `payload.update`
- some are bare verbs: `integrate`, `version`, `validate`, `generate`, `weave`, `extract`
- `knop.addReference` is camelCase after the dot, which is another style mixed in

So I would not single out `knop.create` as the oddball. The odd part is that the contract currently mixes multiple machine naming schemes.

My read:

- keeping the dot is fine if we mean “scoped machine operation key”
- the docs should explicitly distinguish command names from machine keys
- if we want stricter consistency, we should normalize the whole `kind`/`operationId` scheme in one pass, not just change `knop.create`

If you want, I can patch [[sf.api]] to make that split explicit, or draft a concrete normalization proposal for all operation names.

# User_2026-04-04_0724_25

just make sf.api.md consistent. -- I think we can rename "Tentative Operations" too.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0724_51

I’m tightening only `sf.api.md`. First I’m reading the current section shape around the operation names so I can normalize the wording without drifting the broader contract.

I’m making the note self-consistent by treating it as API-machine vocabulary, not CLI prose: renaming the section and normalizing the wording to `kind`/`operationId` tokens.

The note is patched. I’m doing a quick readback to make sure the section now reads cleanly and doesn’t mix CLI phrasing back in.

Updated [[sf.api]] to be internally consistent.

I renamed `Tentative Operations` to `Draft Job Kinds`, added one short note that this file uses machine-facing `kind` / `operationId` tokens, normalized the list to `mesh.create` / `knop.create`, and fixed the later `mesh create` mention to `mesh.create`.

I didn’t touch the broader API spec or manifests here, and I didn’t run tests because this was a docs-only change.

# User_2026-04-04_0729_52

ok, what's next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0730_07

I’m checking the current notes against the settled Alice ladder before answering, so the recommendation lines up with the repo’s actual carried-slice sequence rather than just habit.

Next should be `weave`, not `integrate`.

Specifically, I’d carry the `04-alice-knop-created` -> `05-alice-knop-created-woven` slice next. That’s the first real test of the Knop-side `version + validate + generate` path, and the settled fixture already defines its expected result in [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]] and [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-25-mesh-alice-bio]].

I would not jump to `integrate` yet. That would skip the first Knop weave case and leave a hole between non-woven Knop creation and payload integration.

Concrete next step:
1. Write a new `wd.task.*` note for the first carried `weave` slice targeting `05-alice-knop-created-woven`.
2. Add the manifest-scoped CLI acceptance test for `05-alice-knop-created-woven`.
3. Implement the smallest local `weave` slice that:
   - versions `alice/_knop/_meta`
   - versions `alice/_knop/_inventory`
   - advances `_mesh/_inventory` to a new historical state
   - generates `alice/index.html` plus the Knop-facing pages
4. Only after that move to `integrate` for `05` -> `06`.

If you want, I can turn that into the next task note now and start the `05-alice-knop-created-woven` slice.

# User_2026-04-04_0731_36

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0731_52

I’m taking the next carried slice as `04-alice-knop-created -> 05-alice-knop-created-woven`. First I’ll read the settled fixture and current local code shape so the task note and implementation target the actual woven behavior rather than a guessed subset.

I’ve confirmed the next slice is materially larger than `knop create`: it needs snapshot files, history advancement, and a first real HTML surface. I’m reading the settled `05` files and the current CLI shape now so I can decide the smallest coherent command/API surface before I write the task note and code.

The settled `05` HTML surface is deliberately simple, which is good news: most pages are uniform stubs plus one identifier page for `alice`. I’m reading the remaining page patterns now so the first weave implementation can stay small instead of pretending to build a full renderer.

I’m writing the next task note first. The existing `wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior` note already covers the high-level weave semantics, so this task note will be narrow: first carried local weave slice, first acceptance target, and the exact non-goals for `05`.

I’ve written the task note. I’m moving into the code phase now, and I’m choosing the smallest CLI surface that isn’t goofy: make bare `weave` the first local weave command, with `--workspace` on the root command, instead of introducing `weave weave`.

I’m in the implementation phase now. The first local weave will be deliberately narrow: bare `weave` on a workspace, detect first-weavable Knop support artifacts, version them, advance mesh inventory, and create only the new pages that the settled `05` fixture expects.

I’m patching the core/runtime/CLI now. The implementation will be explicit about scope: it only supports the first Knop weave shape and will fail closed if the workspace isn’t in that expected pre-weave state.

Continuing the `04 -> 05` weave slice. I’m checking the repo guidance, current worktree, and the new weave files before I run typecheck and tests.

The worktree is cleanly scoped to the new weave slice now. I’m reading the added weave modules and tests to catch obvious contract issues before I run the Deno checks.

I’ve got the weave implementation in place. Before changing anything else I’m checking the ontology summary the repo guidance calls out, then I’ll run formatting, typecheck, and tests to see what actually breaks.

The code is past the sketch stage. I’m running format, typecheck, and the test suite now; that will tell us whether the CLI shape and the generated fixture outputs actually hold up.

Formatting is clean. Typecheck and tests are still running; I’m waiting on those before I touch anything else.

The implementation is green: format, typecheck, and the full test suite all passed. I’m doing the required doc pass now so this slice lands as a finished task, not just a passing patch.

The code is stable. I’m deciding whether this slice needs a thin framework example now or whether that would just overstate the contract; in parallel I’m updating the local overview and decision notes that the repo guidance requires.

I’m making the closing documentation pass now: codifying the bare `weave` CLI decision, recording the first carried `04 -> 05` weave scope, and adding thin framework examples so the public contract doesn’t lag the implemented slice.

The closing docs and framework example stubs are in. I’m reading the changed notes and examples once to catch stale wording or over-claimed API semantics before I stop.

The framework examples read cleanly. I’m doing two lightweight checks now: JSON syntax on the new example payloads, and a sweep for stale references to the pre-rename weave task note.

The main repo worktree is coherent. The framework example/doc changes live in the separate dependency repo, so I’m checking that repo’s status separately before I wrap this up.

I’m at the finish line. I’m pulling a compact diff summary from both repos so the close-out can be precise about what landed and what still needs a commit in the separate framework checkout.

Implemented the first carried local `weave` slice for `04-alice-knop-created -> 05-alice-knop-created-woven`. The core planning is in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), runtime execution in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and the CLI now exposes bare top-level `weave` in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts). I added unit, integration, and black-box CLI coverage in [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), [weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and [weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts).

I also closed out the note/doc pass: the task note is now [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-knop-created-woven]], and I updated [[wd.decision-log]], [[wd.codebase-overview]], and [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]. In the separate framework repo I added thin `weave` API examples at [weave-job-request.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/weave-job-request.jsonld) and [weave-job-succeeded.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/weave-job-succeeded.jsonld), plus note updates in [[sf.api]] and [[sf.api.examples]].

Verification: `deno task check` and `deno task test` passed in `weave`. After that I only changed notes/framework examples, and I JSON-validated the two new framework example files. The framework changes are in a separate git repo and will need a separate commit from the `weave` repo changes.

# User_2026-04-04_0744_33

Does the settled fixture ladder really specify a weave after "mesh create"?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0744_44

I’m checking the actual fixture sources rather than relying on the task note wording. I’ll look at the mesh-alice-bio ladder note, the conformance manifests, and the branch layout to see whether `02 -> 03` is explicitly modeled as a `weave` step or whether that was inferred later.

The branch ladder does include `03-mesh-created-woven`, but I want the stronger check: whether the conformance layer explicitly treats `02 -> 03` as operation `weave`, not just as a naming convention. I’m opening the README and the `03` manifest now.

I have the answer. I’m grabbing exact line numbers from the three strongest sources so the reply can be concrete instead of hand-wavy.

Yes, in the current settled fixture corpus it does.

The strongest evidence is the conformance manifest itself: [03-mesh-created-woven.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/03-mesh-created-woven.jsonld#L21) defines the `02-mesh-created` -> `03-mesh-created-woven` transition with `"operationId": "weave"` at [line 31](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/03-mesh-created-woven.jsonld#L31).

The ladder docs say the same thing:
- [mesh-alice-bio/README.md:11-12](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-alice-bio/README.md#L11) says `02-mesh-created` is the manual equivalent of `mesh create`, and `03-mesh-created-woven` is “the result of weaving `02`”.
- [mesh-alice-bio/README.md:30](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-alice-bio/README.md#L30) says `*-woven` branches are the result of running `weave` over the immediately preceding branch.
- [conformance/README.md:11](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/README.md#L11) explicitly maps `03-mesh-created-woven.jsonld` to `02-mesh-created -> 03-mesh-created-woven`.
- [[wd.completed.2026.2026-03-25-mesh-alice-bio|wd.completed.2026.2026-03-25-mesh-alice-bio.md:103-107]] also states that woven branches are `weave` and spells out what `03` should contain.

The only nuance is that this is a fixture-design decision, not something forced by an external standard. So if your concern is “did we invent that later?”, the answer is no for the current settled corpus: it is explicitly encoded in the manifest and README, not just inferred by the implementation. If you want, I can tighten the task-note wording to say “the current settled fixture ladder models…” instead of the slightly stronger “already made the intended execution order clear.”

# User_2026-04-04_0745_32

Regarding open issues, instead of "weave weave", just "weave" for the CLI. The page content doesn't matter much, we'll have to upgrade all the page generation stuff later.
- I think the first local weave should probably target the whole current mesh, but I could be convinced otherwise.

In the future, let me review the task note before you start implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0745_44

That’s the right default stance.

- CLI: bare `weave`, not `weave weave`
- local scope: whole current mesh/workspace by default
- narrowing: optional later, not the primary first-pass behavior
- page generation: keep it minimal and fixture-matching for now; richer rendering can wait

I also agree the note should treat the “whole current mesh” point as a default, not an open issue unless we hit a concrete reason to narrow earlier.

For future tasks, I’ll stop after drafting or updating the `wd.task.*` note and wait for your review before starting implementation, unless you explicitly tell me to proceed.

# User_2026-04-04_0807_01

Is the next step a new task for the next slice?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0807_18

Yes.

The current `04 -> 05` weave slice is a completed slice, so the next implementation-bearing step should be a new `wd.task.*` note for the next carried transition, not an extension of [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-knop-created-woven]]. Per the repo guidance, that’s the right point to start a fresh task note.

The next slice should probably be `05-alice-knop-created-woven -> 06-alice-bio-integrated`, meaning the first local `integrate` slice, not another `weave` slice yet. If you want, I can draft that new task note and stop there for your review before any implementation.

# User_2026-04-04_0807_51

yes

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0808_01

I’m drafting the next task note only and stopping there for review. First I’m pulling the task template and the settled `05 -> 06` fixture context so the note matches the repo’s current slice pattern instead of improvising.

I’ve got the slice identified. I’m reading the `06` manifest and the detailed fixture note now so the new task note is precise about what `integrate` changes and what it explicitly does not do before `07` weaves it.

I have the fixture boundaries. I’m writing a new `wd.task.*` note for the first local `integrate` slice now, scoped narrowly to `05 -> 06` and explicitly excluding `07` weave behavior. I’ll stop after that draft so you can review it before any code changes.

The draft note is in place. I’m doing one quick readback and status check, then I’ll stop so you can review it before any implementation starts.

Drafted the next task note at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]].

It scopes the next carried slice to `05-alice-knop-created-woven -> 06-alice-bio-integrated`, keeps `alice-bio.ttl` at the repo root, adds the `alice/bio` payload artifact plus payload-Knop support artifacts, and explicitly leaves `07` weave behavior, page generation, histories, and Bob auto-extraction out of scope.

I stopped there. The only worktree change is the new task note.

# User_2026-04-04_0813_27

I'd like to start doing branches with PRs so we can get coderabbit reviews and codecov.io reports into the PR. Quality gates too. Please create a task for CI, modelled on what I had for kato and accord, e.g. [[ac.completed.2026.2026-04-03-accord-cli]]

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0813_52

I’m drafting a CI task note only and stopping there for review. First I’m reading the Accord task notes you pointed to and looking for the analogous Kato note so the Weave note matches the existing style and scope.

I found the Kato CI note too. I’m pulling that and the current Weave repo context so the new task reflects your actual CI goals here: PR-based flow, CodeRabbit, Codecov, and quality gates, without copying Accord blindly.

Weave doesn’t have any repo-local GitHub automation yet, so the note needs to be the intake for both in-repo workflow files and the GitHub-side setup. I’m checking for any existing Weave notes on CI/branch protection so I don’t create overlapping task prose.
wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-ci
I’m writing the note now. It will stay at planning level: repo files, GitHub-side settings, rollout phases, and explicit non-goals, with no implementation work yet.

The note is drafted. I’m reading it back once and checking the worktree so I can hand you just the task note cleanly, without touching the already-open integrate note.

Drafted the CI task note at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-ci]].

It is scoped around:
- PR-based development and branch protection
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as the first baseline workflow

I did not start any implementation. The worktree now just has the two untracked task notes:
- [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]]
- [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-ci]]

# User_2026-04-04_0818_19

Should we start the CI task in a new chat?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0818_25

Yes. A new chat is better for the CI task.

Reasons:
- cleaner scope and history
- easier to review the task note against only CI-related decisions
- less chance of accidental bleed-over from the `weave` and `integrate` slice work
- better fit for the “review task note first, then implement” workflow you asked for

Start the new chat from [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-ci]], and I’ll treat that as the sole task context until you approve implementation.

# User_2026-04-04_0833_56

OK, CI should be in place. I've switched to a new branch. Should we tackle [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]] in this chat or start a new one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0834_06

Start a new one.

This chat already mixes:
- the completed `weave` slice
- the CI task drafting
- the integrate task drafting

For `05 -> 06 integrate`, a fresh chat will keep the context tight around [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]], your new branch, and the “review task note first, then implement” workflow. If you open the new chat from that note, I’ll treat it as the sole active task.
