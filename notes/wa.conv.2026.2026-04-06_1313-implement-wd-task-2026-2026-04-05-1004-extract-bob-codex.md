Implement [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob]].

Context:
- `10-alice-bio-updated -> 11-alice-bio-v2-woven` is implemented and passing on this branch.
- next carried slice is `11 -> 12`
- this is the first narrow `extract` slice, so add a dedicated behavior "wd.spec" note for `extract` before implementation 
- start with failing integration and black-box CLI tests against `12-bob-extracted`
- keep the slice non-woven and fixture-first

Constraints:
- update `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` to register `bob/_knop`
- create:
  - `bob/_knop/_meta/meta.ttl`
  - `bob/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl`
  - `bob/_knop/_references/references.ttl`
- create one `ReferenceLink` rooted at `bob/_knop/_references#reference001`
- use `ReferenceRole/Supplemental`
- set `referenceTarget <alice/bio>`
- set `referenceTargetState <alice/bio/_history001/_s0002>`
- keep `alice-bio.ttl` unchanged
- keep existing Alice surfaces unchanged
- do not create any Bob ResourcePages yet; Bob page paths should remain absent
- do not split Bob into a payload artifact
- do not rename the task note to completed unless explicitly asked

Acceptance/testing posture:
- follow [[wd.testing]]
- keep CLI acceptance manifest-scoped for `12-bob-extracted`
- do not treat unrelated fixture `README.md` churn as operation output
- prefer reusing the existing core/runtime/CLI slice patterns from `knop create`, `knop add-reference`, `payload.update`, and the recent `11` weave work

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_0911_29

Implementing the `11 -> 12` extract slice means I need to confirm the repo’s guidance and the existing `11` patterns before I touch tests or fixtures. I’m starting by reading the product vision, the general developer guidance note, and the `extract bob` task note, then I’ll trace the analogous `create`, `add-reference`, `payload.update`, and `11` weave paths in code and tests.

I’ve confirmed the repo-specific guardrails: Deno-first, behavior-spec-driven for external operations, and the task note’s narrow non-woven boundary. Next I’m reading the testing guidance and the nearby behavior specs, then I’ll map the existing slice patterns in runtime, core, CLI, and fixtures so the new tests lock onto the same structure instead of inventing a parallel path.

The behavior notes line up with the task note: `extract` needs its own current spec, and the `12` slice is explicitly “semantic change without weave.” I’m pulling in the ontology summary and the existing implementation/test surfaces now so I can add failing tests against the right seams instead of backfilling them after the fact.

The ontology summary note isn’t in this repo’s vault, which is fine as long as I read it from the embedded ontology workspace instead of guessing. I’ve also confirmed the worktree is dirty only in conversation notes, so I can leave those alone and work around them.

The fixture repo already contains the Bob surface and the framework already has a `12-bob-extracted` manifest, so the main risk is not data availability, it’s matching the existing slice discipline. I’m reading the exact runtime and test helpers now, plus the `11 -> 12` fixture diff, to keep the new path aligned with the established operation/result model.

I’ve confirmed the `12` fixture delta is exactly the narrow set the task note described: one mesh inventory update, three Bob Turtle files, and only `README.md` as unrelated noise. Next I’m reading the existing operation implementations and the manifest-backed test patterns so I can add the failing `extract` tests in the same shape as the previous carried slices.

The current codebase has a consistent split: core plans pure file content, runtime resolves workspace state and applies it atomically, and the CLI is still very thin. I’m checking whether the Bob extract path can reuse existing inventory/meta rendering code or if I need one new focused planner instead of splicing logic across unrelated operations.

The fixture diff makes the implementation boundary very concrete: it’s effectively `knop create` plus `knop add-reference` for a new Bob knop, but without pages, payload splitting, or history/versioning. I’m checking whether `extract` already appears anywhere in the framework or repo so I can keep the request/result naming aligned instead of inventing a contract that will have to be backed out.

The framework is already opinionated: `operationId` is `extract`, the manifest only carries `targetDesignatorPath: bob`, and the Bob link is explicitly pinned to `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002`. I’m reading the framework API note now so the local CLI shape and result semantics inherit that direction instead of drifting into an ad hoc “add-reference plus create” command.

Plan for the `11 -> 12` slice:

1. `in_progress` Draft `[[wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior]]` from the settled `12-bob-extracted` manifest and fixture, keeping the request boundary narrow around `targetDesignatorPath`.
2. `pending` Add failing integration and black-box CLI tests for `11-alice-bio-v2-woven -> 12-bob-extracted`, manifest-scoped and explicit about Bob page absence.
3. `pending` Implement `extract` across `core`, `runtime`, and `cli`, reusing the existing plan/apply patterns but keeping the result non-woven and fixture-first.
4. `pending` Add narrow unit coverage where the planner/validation seam is real, then run targeted tests, lint, and update the relevant notes (`wd.codebase-overview`, decision log/task note) if the implementation settles new behavior.

The spec is where I need to commit to the narrow boundary, so I’m checking the current `11` payload before I write it. If Bob is only discoverable through the settled Alice Bio payload, the note should say that plainly and the runtime should validate that condition instead of silently synthesizing Bob from thin air.

I have the implementation route now: treat `extract` as a narrow planner that composes the proven `knop.create` and `knop.add-reference` patterns, while the runtime derives the single eligible woven payload source from the workspace and refuses ambiguity. Before I code, I’m writing the spec note and then the two top-level failing tests so the contract is locked first.

I’m writing the `extract` behavior note now. The key decision it has to lock is that the first CLI/runtime request only names the target designator, while source resolution is deliberately local, narrow, and fail-closed against the current woven payload surface.

The spec is in place. I’m adding the failing tests now, and I’m keeping the CLI check manifest-scoped instead of reusing the older full-tree equality shortcut because that would blur the `README.md` churn with actual `extract` behavior.

The top-level tests are in place and should currently fail for the right reason: there is no `extract` implementation or CLI yet. I’m running just those new tests first so I can confirm the failure is the missing slice, not a bad assumption in the harness.

The tests are failing at the expected seam: the new runtime module does not exist yet. That’s the right TDD starting point, so I’m moving into the implementation now and will keep the runtime source-resolution logic narrow and explicit instead of letting it sprawl into a generic extractor.

I’m editing the code now. The implementation is going in as a dedicated `extract` operation with its own core/runtime modules, but I’m intentionally composing the proven `knop.create` and `knop.add-reference` planning patterns rather than smearing Bob-specific logic across existing commands.

The implementation patch missed on `src/cli/run.ts` because the context shifted under the large patch. I’m splitting the work into smaller edits now so the code lands cleanly instead of forcing a risky mega-patch through.

The operation code is in. I’m running the new extract tests now to find the first real mismatch against the `12` fixture before I add planner-level unit coverage or doc updates.

The first failure is just an environment mismatch, not a semantic one: this Deno version doesn’t expose `Deno.errors.DirectoryNotEmpty`. I’m trimming that cleanup helper now so the test run gets to the actual extract behavior.

The behavior mismatch is real and useful: I reused `knop.create` too literally, and its mesh-inventory file ordering doesn’t match the carried `12` fixture. I’m fixing that by making `extract` place the new Bob inventory located-file block relative to the source payload working file, which is the real semantic distinction this slice introduces.

The top-level extract path now matches the carried fixture. I’m adding one narrow core test seam next so the planner’s extract-specific pieces stay pinned: the Bob inventory normalization and the explicit `referenceTargetState` insertion are easy places for future regressions if they’re only covered through runtime.

The extract code and tests are green in isolation. Before I run the broader validation pass, I’m updating the repo notes that are supposed to track real behavior changes so the new operation doesn’t land as undocumented code.

I’ve reached the documentation pass. I’m updating the overview and decision log with the specific extract boundary we actually implemented, and I’m marking the task note honestly rather than pretending the framework contract needed a change when the existing manifest already fit this slice.

The code and docs are updated. I’m running the full local CI task now instead of stopping at the extract-only tests, because this slice touched exports and CLI wiring and that’s exactly where cross-suite regressions tend to hide.

CI stopped at formatting, which is fine. I’m applying the formatter first and then rerunning CI so the next failure, if any, is a real code issue rather than style noise.

I’ve finished the implementation and validation pass. I’m doing one last status check now so the close-out is precise about what changed and I can give you a commit message that matches the actual slice rather than a generic summary.

Implemented the `11 -> 12` extract slice. The new behavior spec is in [[wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior]], the shared planner is in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts), the local runtime is in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts), and the CLI now exposes `weave extract <designatorPath>` from [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts). The slice stays non-woven: it creates Bob’s `_meta`, `_inventory`, and `_references`, updates `_mesh/_inventory`, pins the Supplemental link to `alice/bio/_history001/_s0002`, leaves `alice-bio.ttl` and existing Alice surfaces unchanged, and does not create any Bob pages.

Coverage is in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts), [extract_test.ts](../../tests/integration/extract_test.ts), and [extract_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/extract_cli_test.ts). I also updated [[wd.codebase-overview]], [[wd.decision-log]], and the task note [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob]]. `deno task ci` passed.

Suggested commit message:

```text
extract: implement first local bob extraction slice

- add a dedicated extract behavior spec for the carried 11 -> 12 non-woven boundary
- implement shared core/runtime/CLI extract support for creating Bob knop resources from a single woven payload source
- pin the created Supplemental reference to alice/bio and alice/bio/_history001/_s0002 without splitting payload bytes or generating Bob pages
- add core, integration, and manifest-scoped CLI coverage for 12-bob-extracted
- update overview, decision log, and task notes for the new extract slice
```

There are still pre-existing conversation-note worktree changes outside this slice; I left them alone.

# User_2026-04-06_1328_58

next steps?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1329_10

I’d do this next, in order:

1. Commit the extract slice, staging only the real slice files and not the unrelated conversation-note churn.
2. Leave [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-05_1004-extract-bob.md) as a `wd.task.*` note unless you explicitly want the rename.
3. Start the next carried slice: `12-bob-extracted -> 13-bob-extracted-woven`.

For `13`, the right posture is the same as the earlier weave slices:
- reuse [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]] unless `13` exposes a real new weave rule
- start with failing integration and manifest-scoped CLI tests against `13-bob-extracted-woven`
- then implement only the woven delta: Bob support-artifact histories, Bob pages, and the `_mesh/_inventory` advancement that now exposes Bob’s public current surface

If you want, I can start `13-bob-extracted-woven` now.

# User_2026-04-06_1330_11

Start it directly? Fine with me, but we've been doing separate task notes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1330_24

No. `13-bob-extracted-woven` should get its own `wd.task.*` note first.

That slice is a different boundary from `12`:
- it advances from semantic extraction to `weave`
- it introduces Bob histories and Bob page generation
- it likely advances `_mesh/_inventory` again because Bob’s public current surface becomes visible

So I’d keep the discipline:
1. draft a dedicated `wd.task.*` note for `12 -> 13`
2. start with failing integration and manifest-scoped CLI tests
3. implement the woven delta only

If you want, I can do that next: create the new task note and then carry `13-bob-extracted-woven` end to end.

# User_2026-04-06_1331_04

OK, compose the task note plese.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1331_14

I’m drafting a separate `wd.task.*` note for the `12 -> 13` woven slice, not piggybacking it onto the extract note. I’m checking the task template and the settled `13-bob-extracted-woven` fixture/manifest first so the note locks onto the actual carried boundary instead of a guessed weave scope.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1331_29

I’ve got the exact `13` boundary now: Bob support-artifact histories, Bob page materialization, `_mesh/_inventory` advancing to `_s0004`, and `alice/index.html` changing because Bob becomes a live page, while `alice-bio.ttl` stays unchanged. I’m writing the task note as a separate weave slice that reuses the existing weave spec rather than inventing another broad spec note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1331_51

I’m choosing a dedicated `13` task note name and frontmatter now. Then I’ll draft it in the same style as the earlier slice notes: clear scope, explicit non-goals, and a fixture-first implementation plan that starts with failing tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1332_22

I’m writing the note now as an unstarted task note, not pre-marking any implementation boxes. It will lock the `13` scope to the settled fixture: Bob histories, Bob pages, mesh inventory `_s0004`, and the small but real `alice/index.html` weave update.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1332_58

Created the new task note at [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md).

It treats `12-bob-extracted -> 13-bob-extracted-woven` as a separate carried `weave` slice, reuses [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]], and locks the scope to:
- Bob support-artifact histories
- Bob current and historical ResourcePages
- `_mesh/_inventory` advancing to `_s0004`
- the carried `alice/index.html` update
- keeping `alice-bio.ttl` unchanged
- ignoring unrelated fixture `README.md` churn in acceptance

If you want, I can start the slice now from that note: failing integration test first, then manifest-scoped CLI test, then implementation.

I’m checking the current `extract` code and tests against each CodeRabbit comment before changing anything. I’ll verify whether each point is still real in this branch, then patch only the ones that hold up and rerun the relevant validation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1842_33

I’m checking each CodeRabbit point against the current extract slice before touching anything. First I’m reading the referenced files at the exact seams it called out so I can separate real issues from generic linting advice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1842_56

I’ve verified the feedback against the current code. Four of the points are worth fixing in this slice; one needs a narrow refactor rather than hand-waving because the core/runtime extract validators already risk drifting apart. I’m checking the exact helper call sites now, then I’ll patch only the extract-related code paths CodeRabbit identified.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1843_33

The `run.ts` point is real but narrow: only extract and `knop add-reference` use those required-value helpers today, so I can remove the misleading default instead of introducing a whole new CLI error type. I’m also centralizing the extract designator-path validation now, because the core/runtime duplication is real and it’s cheap to eliminate without touching the older operations.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1843_50

I’m patching the extract code and tests now. The main changes are: explicit log-file existence assertions in the CLI test, removing the CLI helper’s command-specific default error factory, documenting the regex assumption in `injectReferenceTargetState`, surfacing cleanup failures in runtime, and sharing the extract designator-path validator between core and runtime.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1844_23

The patches are in. I’m running formatting and the focused validation path first, because the `run.ts` helper signature change can break compile quickly if I missed a call site.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1844_35

The focused extract suite is green. I changed a shared helper module and the CLI input helper signature, so I’m running full CI now to make sure there isn’t a wider regression hiding outside the extract tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1845_14

Verified the CodeRabbit feedback against the current extract code. All five points were real enough to fix in this slice, and I patched them.

- [extract_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/extract_cli_test.ts): replaced the two bare log-file `Deno.stat(...)` calls with explicit existence assertions that fail with clear messages.
- [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts): removed the misleading default `KnopAddReferenceInputError` factory from the generic required-value helpers and made callers pass the right error type explicitly.
- [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts): documented the fixture-format assumption in `injectReferenceTargetState` and reinforced it through the extract planner test in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts).
- [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts): `removeEmptyDirectoriesBestEffort` now still ignores `NotFound` but emits a warning for other cleanup failures instead of swallowing them silently.
- [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts), [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts), [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts): shared the extract designator-path validation so core and runtime use the same canonical rules while still validating independently.

Validation passed with `deno task ci`.

extract: tighten extract validation and test assertions

- replace bare extract CLI log-file stat checks with explicit existence assertions and clearer failure messages
- remove the command-specific default error factory from the CLI required-value helpers and require explicit caller error types
- document the fixture-format assumptions behind extract referenceTargetState string injection and reinforce them in extract planner coverage
- share extract designator-path validation between core and runtime to avoid rule drift while preserving defense-in-depth
- warn on unexpected best-effort extract cleanup failures instead of swallowing non-NotFound errors silently
- keep the extract slice green under full `deno task ci`
```

# User_2026-04-06_1854_16

OK, start the new slice/task.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1854_27

Starting `12-bob-extracted -> 13-bob-extracted-woven` now. I’m checking the new task note, the current worktree, and the existing `weave` planning/tests first so I can add the failing `13` integration and manifest-scoped CLI tests against the right seams before touching implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1854_41

I have enough context to lock the test boundary. The first real risk for `13` is not just history creation, it’s that the current `weave` CLI helper still assumes full-tree equality and would accidentally pull `README.md` churn into the acceptance result, so I’m shaping the new tests to stay manifest-scoped from the start.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1856_03

Starting `12-bob-extracted -> 13-bob-extracted-woven` from the new task note. I’m verifying the current weave path, then I’ll add failing integration and manifest-scoped CLI tests before touching runtime behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1856_09

The current weave implementation only knows the earlier Alice slices. I’m reading the rest of the planner and runtime now so the failing tests pin the exact delta for Bob instead of guessing at the shape.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1856_15

The fixture boundary is the hard source of truth here, especially because `13` updates an existing page and ignores unrelated `README.md` churn. I’m pulling the manifest and ref diff now so the tests target only the carried surface.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1856_25

I’ve confirmed the slice boundary: `13` is not just “more pages”, it also introduces the first weave case that updates an existing non-Bob page and advances mesh inventory to a new public state. Next I’m reading the exact fixture files that need to be reproduced so the implementation stays narrow.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1856_55

The main implementation gap is now clear: the current weave path can only create new pages, but `13` also needs to update existing HTML (`alice/index.html` and `_mesh/_inventory/_history001/index.html`). I’m checking the exact non-woven Bob inputs now so I can thread just enough context through planning instead of bolting on a broad renderer rewrite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1858_13

I’m adding the failing tests now. The first change is to pin `13` in the unit, integration, and CLI seams, and to make the CLI helper stop treating unrelated fixture files as operation output for this slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1859_03

The new acceptance checks are in. I’m running the targeted weave tests now to capture the current failure mode before changing planner/runtime code.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1859_10

The first run failed at the Deno permission boundary, not in the slice logic. I’m switching to the project’s normal test permissions so we see the real Bob-weave failure instead of an env-access false positive.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1902_16

I have the implementation shape now: a new extracted-weave slice, source-payload loading in the runtime, and narrow custom HTML generation only for the pages `13` actually changes. I’m patching planner/runtime/types first, then I’ll fill in the Bob/Alice/mesh page renderers and re-run the targeted tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1907_20

The slice is implemented narrowly enough to exercise now: new Bob-specific weave classification, source-payload resolution, mesh/inventory versioning, and the few page surfaces `13` actually changes. I’m running the targeted weave tests again to catch any shape drift before broader validation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1907_29

Type-checking is blocking on the new payload-quad helpers, not on slice behavior. I’m tightening those types first, then I’ll re-run the Bob-specific tests to see the actual fixture mismatches.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1907_59

The Bob reference page is now the main mismatch. The issue is path semantics: the fixture resolves cross-resource links from the resource URL (`.../_references`), not from the backing `index.html` file path. I’m correcting that renderer now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1908_28

The black-box CLI path is green now, so the remaining failure is in my new integration assertion shape rather than the weave output itself. I’m fixing that test to compare created-path sets consistently, then I’ll add a focused core planner test and run the full weave slice coverage.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1909_05

The Bob weave slice is green at unit, integration, and manifest-scoped CLI scope. I’m doing the cleanup pass now: formatting, broader weave regression coverage, then the usual note updates so the new slice is recorded the same way the earlier carried work was.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1909_20

The code is in place. I’m updating the developer notes now so the repo’s carried-slice inventory reflects that `weave` now reaches `13-bob-extracted-woven`, without renaming the task note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1910_03

I’ve updated the slice notes and am running the full repo validation now, not just the targeted weave tests. That will catch any drift from the new planner/runtime types or the reference-page rendering change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1910_49

Implemented `12-bob-extracted -> 13-bob-extracted-woven` end to end. The new slice is carried through [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts): it recognizes the first extracted-resource weave, versions Bob `_meta`, `_inventory`, and `_references`, advances `_mesh/_inventory` to `_s0004`, generates the Bob current/history pages, and updates `alice/index.html` when Bob becomes a live mesh resource. I also added slice coverage in [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), [weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and [weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts), with the CLI acceptance staying manifest-scoped for `13` so unrelated fixture `README.md` churn is ignored.

I updated [wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md), [wd.codebase-overview.md](wd.codebase-overview.md), [wd.decision-log.md](wd.decision-log.md), and checked off the implementation plan in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md). `deno task ci` passed.

There is unrelated conversation-note churn in the worktree:

# User_2026-04-06_1910_49

Are we missing any wd.spec* files?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1911_00

I’m checking the current `wd.spec.*` inventory against the carried operations and task notes, so the answer is grounded in the repo rather than memory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1911_06

I’ve got the inventory. I’m checking the two open non-slice tasks that don’t already have matching specs so I can separate “not needed” from “probably missing”.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1911_25

Short answer: for the current carried operation surfaces, no obvious `wd.spec.*` gaps.

Current behavior-spec inventory covers the implemented behavior-bearing operations:
- [wd.spec.2026-04-03-mesh-create.md](wd.spec.2026-04-03-mesh-create.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-03-knop-create.md](wd.spec.2026-04-03-knop-create.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-04-payload-update-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-04-payload-update-behavior.md)
- [wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-05-extract-behavior.md)

The weave slice tasks are intentionally reusing the shared weave spec, so they are not missing per-slice specs:
- [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_1553-weave-alice-bio-referenced-woven.md)
- [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-05_0903-weave-alice-bio-v2-woven.md)
- [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-06_1331-weave-bob-extracted-woven.md)

The only likely future gap is [wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md), but that note is still basically empty. If that becomes a real externally visible behavior slice, it should probably get its own `wd.spec.*`. By contrast, [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) looks like internal cleanup, so I would not create a behavior spec for it.

more coderabbit comments for previous slice:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/core/designator_segments.ts`:
- Around line 40-46: The error message in normalizeSafeDesignatorPath currently
mentions toKnopPath which is misleading; update the createError call in the loop
that validates SAFE_DESIGNATOR_SEGMENT_PATTERN (the segment validation using
SAFE_DESIGNATOR_SEGMENT_PATTERN inside normalizeSafeDesignatorPath) to reference
normalizeSafeDesignatorPath (or a generic phrasing like "path validation only
accepts...") instead of "toKnopPath", keeping the same allowed pattern text and
context in the message.

In `@src/core/extract/extract.ts`:
- Around line 135-143: The current catch block that handles KnopCreateInputError
and KnopAddReferenceInputError rethrows a new ExtractInputError but loses the
original stack; update the throw so the new ExtractInputError preserves the
original error as its cause (e.g., construct ExtractInputError with the original
error as the cause) inside the same catch handler where KnopCreateInputError and
KnopAddReferenceInputError are detected to retain debugging context.
- Around line 182-246: Both normalizeWorkingFilePath and
normalizeRelativeIriPath duplicate path-validation logic; extract a shared
helper (e.g., validateNormalizedPath or normalizePathBase) that accepts the raw
string, fieldName, and an option flag (allowWhitespace or rejectWhitespace) and
performs trim, empty check, leading/trailing slash check, unsupported-char
check, empty-segment check, and dot-segment check; then refactor
normalizeWorkingFilePath to call the helper with rejectWhitespace=true and
normalizeRelativeIriPath to call it with rejectWhitespace=false (or vice versa)
so the whitespace rule remains correct while removing the duplicated validation
code.

In `@src/runtime/extract/extract.ts`:
- Around line 640-643: The current loop copies the live target
(Deno.copyFile(file.absolutePath, file.backupPath)) then renames temp into
place, which creates a TOCTOU window; instead copy from the stable temp (use
Deno.copyFile(file.tempPath, file.backupPath)) or acquire an advisory lock
around the pair of operations so the backup reflects the exact data being
installed; update the loop handling stagedPlanMutation.updatedFiles to use
file.tempPath as the source for backups (or add explicit file locking) before
calling Deno.rename(file.tempPath, file.absolutePath).

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1914_05

I’m verifying each CodeRabbit point against the current extract code before changing anything. First step is to read the referenced spots and confirm which comments still apply on this branch.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1914_20

Three of the comments look real on inspection: the misleading designator-path error text, the lost cause when rewrapping extract input errors, and the duplicated path-validation logic. The staged-backup comment does not look correct as written, because rollback currently depends on backups preserving the pre-commit file bytes, so I’m fixing the first three and leaving the backup logic unchanged.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1914_35

I’m making the extract-side fixes now. I’m also adding one regression test for wrapped causes so we don’t lose that context again; the backup-path comment is staying as-is because changing it to `tempPath` would break rollback semantics.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1915_01

I’ve patched the shared validation and error-wrapping paths. I’m adding one focused core regression test for preserved causes now, then I’ll run extract-related validation and a full CI pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1915_22

The extract-targeted coverage is green. I’m running the full repo checks now so these validation changes don’t drift against the rest of the carried slices.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1916_07

Verified all four comments against the current code.

- Fixed the misleading segment-validation message in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts).
- Fixed extract error rewrapping in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts) so `ExtractInputError` now preserves the original `KnopCreateInputError`/`KnopAddReferenceInputError` as `cause`.
- Refactored the duplicated extract path validation in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts) into one shared helper while keeping the existing whitespace behavior split between working-file paths and relative IRI paths.
- Added a regression test for preserved causes in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts).

I did not apply the `tempPath -> backupPath` suggestion in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts). That would break rollback semantics, because rollback currently depends on `backupPath` holding the pre-commit bytes for the live file, not the new staged bytes. If we want to harden that area, the right follow-up is explicit locking or a different atomic swap strategy, not copying the staged temp into the backup.

`deno task ci` passed.

# User_2026-04-06_1918_45

Codecov is a little low for this PR, are there opportunities for valuable testing?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1919_01

I’m checking the actual coverage pressure points in the files touched by this PR instead of guessing from the Codecov badge. First I’ll look at the diff and local coverage on the modified extract/weave paths, then I’ll separate high-value gaps from test noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1919_07

The current worktree is clean apart from a conversation note, so the testing opportunities need to be inferred from the committed PR code rather than unstaged changes. I’m looking at the recent commits and local coverage on the new extract/weave paths now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1919_12

The PR delta is concentrated in `core/runtime extract` and the new Bob weave support, so that’s where Codecov pressure will be. I’m running coverage detail on those files specifically to find high-signal gaps, not just low-percentage lines.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1920_06

I have the coverage picture. I’m reading the new extract/weave code paths once more so I can recommend tests that exercise real invariants rather than just chasing percentages.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1920_12

The obvious low-value percentage chaser would be “test every helper branch in the giant weave planner.” I’m avoiding that and checking where a small number of tests would actually harden the new Bob/extract behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1920_32

Yes. There are a few worthwhile additions, but I would keep them targeted rather than trying to brute-force the percentage.

**High Value**
- Add a unit test for pinned extracted `ReferenceCatalog` page rendering in [pages_test.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts). [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts) now has a separate branch for `referenceTargetStatePath`, and that path already regressed once on relative-link calculation.
- Add negative unit tests for extracted-weave invariants in [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts). The highest-signal missing cases in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) are:
  - missing `referenceTargetStatePath`
  - mismatched `referenceTargetPath`
  - mismatched `latestHistoricalStatePath`
- Add fail-closed runtime tests around extracted-source resolution in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts). The new `loadReferenceTargetSourcePayloadArtifact` path is important and mostly only covered by the happy path. Good cases are:
  - Bob reference points to a source inventory that is missing
  - source payload exists but has no woven current history
  - extracted `ReferenceCatalog` link block is malformed

**Good But Secondary**
- Add direct unit tests for shared path validation in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts) and [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts). Those files are low in coverage, and a few focused tests for reserved segments, unsafe chars, whitespace rejection for working-file paths, and dot-segment rejection would be useful because the helpers are shared.
- Add narrow tests for the brittle string-surgery seams in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts):
  - `injectReferenceTargetState` fails closed on unexpected Turtle shape
  - `reorderMeshInventoryLocatedFiles` is a no-op when already ordered

**Not Worth Chasing**
- I would not try to raise coverage by snapshot-testing every long HTML/Turtle renderer branch in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts). That will buy percentage faster than confidence.
- I also would not force a test around the extract backup/rename TOCTOU concern unless we first add a real fault-injection seam in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts). Right now that would be brittle.

If you want the best return for this PR, I’d do these three:
1. pinned extracted `ReferenceCatalog` page unit test
2. extracted-weave negative planner tests
3. extracted-source runtime failure test

# User_2026-04-06_1921_42

ok, please do.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1921_51

I’m adding the three highest-value tests: the pinned extracted `ReferenceCatalog` page renderer case, negative planner checks for the Bob extracted-weave invariants, and one runtime failure case around resolving Bob’s woven source payload.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1921_54

I have enough context to patch the tests directly. I’m keeping the additions narrow: one new renderer test, three planner invariant tests, and one runtime failure test that mutates the Bob fixture into a broken woven-source state.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1922_14

I’m editing the three test files now: one renderer unit test, planner negative tests built from the Bob fixture input, and one integration test that corrupts the source payload history before weaving Bob.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1922_57

I’ve added the tests. I’m formatting and running targeted weave coverage now so we see whether these are exposing real regressions or just increasing exercised branches as intended.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1923_11

The first new negative planner test is failing earlier than intended because I changed the source-payload object, which trips the mesh-shape guard first. I’m narrowing that test to corrupt the Bob reference target instead, so it exercises the mismatch check we actually care about.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1923_33

The new tests are green in the targeted weave areas. I’m running the full repo checks now, and then I’ll do one more coverage pass so we can judge whether these additions were meaningful for the PR rather than just locally green.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1924_30

I added the three highest-signal tests and I’m finishing validation now: full CI plus a fresh coverage run to see whether the additions moved the right files, not just the percentage.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1924_34

The new tests are doing what we wanted: CI is green, and the coverage run shows improved exercise exactly in the Bob extract/weave paths rather than broad snapshot churn. I’m checking the final diff now so I can summarize the changes cleanly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1924_46

Added the three tests that were most likely to buy real confidence rather than synthetic percentage:

- [pages_test.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts) now covers pinned extracted `ReferenceCatalog` rendering, including the historical-state link branch.
- [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts) now has fail-closed planner tests for missing pinned state, mismatched source payload path, and mismatched source payload state.
- [weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts) now checks that Bob weave fails closed when the referenced Alice payload has no woven current history.

Validation passed with `deno task ci` and `deno task test:coverage`. Current coverage is `74.2%` branch / `77.2%` line overall, and the fresh report is at [coverage/html/index.html](../../coverage/html/index.html). I left the unrelated Dendron note churn alone.

Suggested commit message:

# User_2026-04-06_1924_58

I think we're almost done this weave implementation. Any last follow up? Any updates for [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) - and is that our next step, before diving into payload-publishing?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1925_08

I’m checking the current task notes and guidance first so I can answer from the repo’s actual stated plan, not memory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1925_16

I’ve got the note context. I’m checking the code paths named in the RDF parsing task now to separate “still open” from “already partially done.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1925_29

There’s been some partial movement already: `core/weave` now has RDF quad helpers, but the main slice-detection and assertion paths are still mostly string-based. I’m pulling the exact helper area so I can tell you whether `wd.task...rdf-parsing` needs updating or just reprioritizing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1926_07

One thing changed after Bob extract/weave landed: the RDF-parsing task note is slightly stale. I’m checking `extract` too, because it added another string-surgery seam that probably belongs in that note even if it’s low priority.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1926_29

I’ve got the answer. I’m grabbing exact line anchors for the remaining brittle read paths so I can point you to the real blockers, not hand-wave.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1927_00

For the current carried RDF/Turtle ladder, yes, we’re basically done. I would not say “weave is done” globally, because payload publishing will introduce a new weave family, but the current `01 -> 13` implementation arc looks closed.

The only follow-up I’d prioritize before payload publishing is the high-risk RDF parsing cleanup. The broad note at [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) is still directionally right, but it is slightly stale. It should now explicitly include:
- the duplicated runtime `meshBase` regex loaders in [create.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/create.ts#L198), [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts#L300), [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts#L213), and [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L183)
- the newer string-based runtime readers in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts#L260) and [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L198)
- the low-priority string-surgery seams in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L260)

One important nuance: I would not mark the current RDF parsing checkboxes complete yet. The note should also record that `core/weave` already has a partial RDF-aware seam for source payload lookup via `n3` in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2628), but that does not satisfy the main cleanup items.

So yes, I think RDF parsing is the next step before payload publishing, but only the narrow read-path part:
1. shared RDF-aware `meshBase` loader across `knop create`, `integrate`, `extract`, and `weave`
2. shared parsed inventory helpers for runtime candidate discovery in `extract` and `weave`
3. then move to markdown payload publishing

I would not block payload publishing on the later graph-mutation refactors in `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate`. Those are real debt, but they are a bigger rewrite and not the best sequencing for momentum.

If you want, I can update [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) now and narrow it into the exact next carried cleanup slice.

- Around line 150-155: The two helper functions toRelativeResourceHref and
toRelativeHref contain identical logic (both return
posix.relative(posix.dirname(from), target)); consolidate them by removing one
and updating all callers to use a single canonical helper (choose the clearer
name for your domain, e.g., toRelativeHref or keep toRelativeResourceHref) or,
if you intentionally need both for semantic clarity, implement one as a thin
wrapper that calls the other and add a brief doc comment explaining the semantic
distinction; update references to the removed function accordingly.
- Around line 58-94: The currentLinks mapping in src/runtime/weave/pages.ts
repeats toRelativeResourceHref(…) and escapeHtml(…) calls multiple times making
the template verbose; refactor the mapping in the page.currentLinks generation
to compute and reuse local variables (e.g., targetHref =
toRelativeResourceHref(targetBasePath, link.referenceTargetPath), stateHref =
link.referenceTargetStatePath && toRelativeResourceHref(targetBasePath,
link.referenceTargetStatePath), and their escaped equivalents
escapedTargetHref/escapedStateHref and escapedFragment/escapedRole) and then use
those variables inside the two template branches to keep the string templates
concise and avoid duplicate calls in the map callback for currentLinks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1927_07

I’m checking the current `weave` and page-rendering helpers against the comments first, then I’ll patch only the ones that are still real and run the relevant tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1928_16

I verified the comments. The duplication is real, and the pages helper collapse is safe as long as we keep the distinction in the call arguments, not in separate function bodies. I’m patching that into a shared utility module and adding narrow utility tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1928_28

I’ve confirmed the exact helper surface. Next step is a small shared utility module plus a focused test file so we don’t regress escaping or relative-link behavior while deduplicating.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1928_41

I’m editing the shared helper extraction now. After that I’ll run the page tests, weave tests, and `deno task ci` so we can tell whether this was purely structural or shook any relative-link assumptions loose.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1929_24

The helper extraction is in. I’m formatting and running the focused weave/page tests first, then I’ll do a full `deno task ci` pass if those stay green.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1929_30

The refactor compiled cleanly. I’m waiting on the focused weave/page test run now; if that stays green I’ll run the full CI sweep.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1929_36

Targeted tests are green. Full CI is in the long test phase now; I’m waiting on that before I close this out.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1929_50

The new shared helper has held through unit and e2e coverage so far. CI is just finishing the last acceptance fixtures now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1930_16

Verified the three nitpicks against current code. They were real, and I fixed them.

- Added shared HTML/page helpers in [html.ts](../../src/core/weave/html.ts) and moved both [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L1) and [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L1) onto them.
- Preserved error behavior by keeping runtime `toResourcePath(...)` on the default `Error` path while core `weave` passes a `WeaveInputError` factory at [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2372).
- Removed the duplicate `toRelativeResourceHref` body in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L61) and reused the same shared `toRelativeHref(...)` helper with the existing resource-path argument.
- Refactored the `referenceCatalog` link rendering in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L63) to compute local href/escaped values once instead of repeating calls inline.
- Added regression coverage for the shared helpers in [html_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/html_test.ts).

Validation passed with `deno task ci`.

There is still unrelated note churn in [wd.conv.2026.2026-04-06_1313-implement-wd-task-2026-2026-04-05-1004-extract-bob-codex.md](wd.conv.2026.2026-04-06_1313-implement-wd-task-2026-2026-04-05-1004-extract-bob-codex.md); I left that alone.

# User_2026-04-06_1930_16

Yes, update [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md)

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1930_26

I’m updating the RDF parsing task note to match the code as it exists now, especially the newer extract paths and the partial RDF-aware seam already in `core/weave`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1931_09

I’ve got the revised structure. I’m rewriting the note in place so it reflects the current post-`extract` / post-`13` code and explicitly separates the near-term runtime cleanup from the later mutation rewrite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1932_02

The note rewrite is in. I’m reviewing the final diff to make sure the task now points at the actual next cleanup slice and doesn’t accidentally over-commit us to the larger graph-mutation work.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1932_07

Updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md).

The note now:
- reflects the post-`extract` / post-`13` codebase instead of the earlier pre-Bob snapshot
- adds `extract` to the runtime `meshBase` regex inventory
- calls out the duplicated runtime Turtle discovery paths in `extract` and `weave`
- records the partial RDF-aware progress already present in `core/weave`
- explicitly separates the near-term runtime read-path cleanup from the later `_mesh/_inventory` graph-mutation rewrite
- states that the runtime read-path cleanup is the better next step before [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing]]

I did not run CI for this one because it is a task-note-only update.

docs: refresh rdf parsing task scope after extract and bob weave

- update [[wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] to reflect the current post-`extract` and post-`13-bob-extracted-woven` codebase
- add the missing `extract` runtime `meshBase` regex loader and the duplicated `extract`/`weave` Turtle discovery paths to the debt inventory
- record the partial RDF-aware seam already present in `core/weave` so the cleanup plan builds on existing quad parsing work
- clarify that the next recommended step is shared runtime read-path cleanup before [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing]]
- keep the larger `_mesh/_inventory` graph-mutation rewrite explicitly in scope, but no longer present it as the immediate blocker
```

weave: dedupe html helpers and refresh rdf parsing follow-up scope

- extract shared weave HTML utilities for resource-path derivation, relative href generation, mesh labeling, and HTML escaping
- update core weave and runtime page rendering to use the shared helpers while preserving existing error behavior
- simplify reference-catalog page rendering by reusing local escaped href and label values instead of repeating helper calls inline
- add focused helper coverage for shared HTML escaping, relative hrefs, mesh-label derivation, and caller-specific toResourcePath error handling
- keep the refactor green under full deno task ci
- update [[wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] to reflect the post-extract and post-13 codebase, including extract runtime readers and the current recommended cleanup order before markdown payload publishing
```

# User_2026-04-06_1947_59

Coderabbit has a comment that we should be able to incorporate into the RDF task:

In `@src/core/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 2095-2219: The replacement logic in
renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle relies on exact Turtle string
shapes (via replaceExactOrThrow) and is fragile to whitespace/predicate-order
changes; add a clear doc comment at the top of
renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle explaining this coupling,
listing the exact replaceExactOrThrow match strings it depends on, noting
maintainers must update these replacements whenever the mesh inventory shape
assertions change, and suggest adding/adjusting unit tests that assert the exact
input shapes to catch regressions.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1948_09

I’m checking the exact `core/weave` replacement seam first so I can fold the CodeRabbit concern into the RDF task note with the right scope and wording.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1948_15

I checked the function. That CodeRabbit point is valid, and it belongs in the RDF task as another fixture-shaped Turtle surgery seam in `core/weave`, not as a separate task.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1948_28

Added that concern to [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md).

I folded it into the existing RDF-debt inventory as:
- another Priority 4 narrow Turtle-surgery seam in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2095)
- a testing expectation that any retained `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` seam should have exact-shape regression tests
- a Related CodeRabbit note calling out that this function should either become parser-aware or be explicitly documented and guarded by shape tests if kept temporarily

I did not run CI because this was another task-note-only update.
