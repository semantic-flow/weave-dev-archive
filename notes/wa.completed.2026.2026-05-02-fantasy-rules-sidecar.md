desc: sidecar mesh fixture for dereferenceable ontology and SHACL publishing
updated: 1777878162292
created: 1777705655304
---

## Goals

- Build out the new fixture repository named `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`.
- Use the fixture to prove the docs-rooted sidecar mesh pattern for an ontology project: source files live outside the mesh root, while public identifiers, generated pages, and historical snapshots live under `docs/`.
- Exercise the dereferenceable ontology publishing use case described in [[ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology]] with a small fantasy-rules ontology and SHACL graph.
- Use the [System Reference Document 5.2.1](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf) as the source-reference boundary for fantasy-rules vocabulary work, subject to its CC-BY-4.0 attribution requirements.
- Use the [SRD 5.2 Markdown transcription](https://github.com/springbov/dndsrd5.2_markdown/blob/main/DND-SRD-5.2-CC.md) as a working convenience source for review and extraction, while keeping the official SRD source and attribution statement authoritative.
- Keep the domain intentionally small: enough to feel real, not enough to become a fantasy rules knowledge-graph project.
- Use the fixture to improve Weave's sidecar ergonomics while keeping general resource-page presentation behavior in the separate renderer task.
- Include the raw RDF content on `RdfDocument` resource pages, not just links to Turtle files.
- Evaluate a safe JavaScript URL-polish behavior for generated resource pages where the browser URL can display the canonical IRI without a trailing slash.
- Capture reusable conventions for future ontology projects such as URPX without putting URPX-specific complexity into the fixture.

## Summary

`mesh-alice-bio` has been a good whole-repo reference mesh, but it is no longer the right fixture for the next publication topology problem: sidecar meshes. The next useful fixture should be a normal project repo whose primary source files are not themselves the public mesh root.

`mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` should be that fixture. It should look like a small ontology project:

- authored ontology source under `ontology/`
- authored SHACL source under `shacl/`
- optional examples/tests under `examples/` or `test/`
- a Semantic Flow sidecar mesh under `docs/`

The public GitHub Pages surface would be `docs/`, with stable artifact IRIs such as:

- `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology`
- `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl`
- `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/releases/v0.0.1`
- `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/releases/v0.0.1`

The first versioned Turtle bytes should use the artifact-local Semantic Flow chain with custom segments: ArtifactHistory segment `releases`, HistoricalState segment `v0.0.1`, ArtifactManifestation segment `ttl`, then the source filename. For example, the first ontology release located file should be `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`.

The authored source files should remain in the project-appropriate source tree, while `docs/` carries the public mesh, generated resource pages, and copied historical release bytes.

The fixture should still use the Alice Bio branch-ladder pattern, but with one important clarification from the completed Alice Bio work: branches are the inspectable carrier for state, while Accord manifests are the acceptance contract for transitions. The branches are useful for human review and for automated comparison: a test can check out a source branch, run the intended operation or `weave`, and compare the produced workspace against the destination branch using the corresponding Accord manifest. The manifests should be created alongside the branch ladder as soon as each transition is settled, not deferred until final documentation cleanup.

The first ladder should stay focused on the core sidecar path:

- `00-blank-slate`
- `01-source-only`
- `02-sidecar-mesh-created`
- `03-sidecar-mesh-created-woven`
- `04-ontology-integrated`
- `05-ontology-integrated-woven`
- `06-shacl-integrated`
- `07-shacl-integrated-woven`
- `08-ontology-and-shacl-terms-extracted`
- `09-ontology-and-shacl-terms-extracted-woven`
- `10-root-knop`
- `11-root-knop-woven`
- `12-gunaar-example-dataset`
- `13-gunaar-example-dataset-woven`
- `14-first-release`
- `15-first-release-woven`
- `16-version-bump`
- `17-version-bump-woven`

The first named release pair should come after the root/examples collection surface and the Gunaar dataset pair, so the release slice exercises multiple histories in a richer mesh rather than only the two primary RDF documents.

The first follow-up release pair should immediately exercise the same named release histories with `v0.0.2`, including at least one authored ontology or SHACL source change that affects an already extracted term page and at least one new mesh-scoped term discoverable by all-terms extraction. This makes the version bump a practical test that extracted pages refresh from changed source RDF rather than only testing copied release bytes, while also bringing the fixture forward from the intentionally narrow `08` extraction slice to source-scoped all-terms extraction.

## Discussion

This fixture should carry several related questions at once, but they should not all be treated as one inseparable implementation slice.

The first question is sidecar topology:

- can Weave create and operate a mesh rooted at `docs/`?
- can a mesh artifact use `workingLocalRelativePath` to point at adjacent repo-local source such as `../ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`?
- can operational config allow that adjacent path while still rejecting arbitrary traversal?
- can weave copy historical snapshots into the public mesh under `docs/`?
- can generated pages and support artifacts stay under `docs/` without exposing the entire repo as a public Pages surface?

The second question is ontology publication shape:

- the ontology artifact should be a `DigitalArtifact`, likely a `PayloadArtifact`, an `RdfDocument`, and an `owl:Ontology`
- the SHACL artifact should be a `DigitalArtifact`, likely a `PayloadArtifact`, an `RdfDocument`, and a `sh:ShapesGraph`; it may also be an `owl:Ontology` if it carries ontology-style metadata
- release history should use artifact-local custom path segments such as `ontology/releases/v0.0.1` and `shacl/releases/v0.0.1`, where `releases` is the ArtifactHistory segment and `v0.0.1` is the HistoricalState segment
- Turtle release bytes should sit under a `ttl` ArtifactManifestation segment, producing located-file paths such as `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`
- `owl:versionIRI` should point to versioned bytes, such as `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`
- `dcterms:hasVersion` should point from the ontology artifact to the Semantic Flow `HistoricalState`, but only once that state has actually been woven
- richer Semantic Flow artifact/history/manifestation/located-file detail can live in mesh inventory and support artifacts rather than being forced into the ontology source document

The ontology source should eventually publish a small Semantic Flow-compliant version metadata slice, but not in `01-source-only` and not speculatively before the historical state and located Turtle bytes exist. For the first source/integration branches, avoid `dcterms:hasVersion` and `owl:versionIRI`. Add them when the release/weave branch materializes the corresponding `HistoricalState`, `ArtifactManifestation`, and `LocatedFile`.

The source ontology is its own meaningful workstream. The SRD 5.2.1 document is large, even before deciding what should become classes, controlled values, examples, SHACL shapes, labels, definitions, and attribution. This task should not pretend that `fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` is just a quick fixture stub. The first ontology slice should be curated deliberately, with enough domain structure to exercise ontology publishing without dragging the mesh-sidecar work into a full SRD modeling project.

The first ontology seed should stay small: `AbilityScore`, `Alignment`, `Character`, and a few representative controlled values or examples are enough. Larger SRD modeling work belongs in later task notes.

The Markdown transcription makes the small seed review tractable. It has directly relevant sections for the six abilities and ability scores, character-creation ability score assignment, alignment, and glossary definitions for ability score/modifier, alignment, and player character. That is enough to justify the first seed slice without modeling the larger SRD.

Use slash term IRIs first, not hash IRIs. The fixture should eventually support both patterns, but slash IRIs are the better first proof because term resource pages can stand independently and deprecated or removed terms do not force the ontology document page to keep carrying every old term description forever. The first-pass term path should be ontology-root `ontology/...`, for example `https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/AbilityScore`. The local rationale is also captured in `/home/djradon/hub/djradon/dendron-workspace/public-notes/vs.hash-vs-slash.md`.

The authored Turtle prefix should use `fant:` for the fantasy-rules ontology namespace, with `@prefix fant: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/> .`. Full IRIs remain fine in generated mesh RDF where they make cross-artifact relations clearer.

The third question is whether the new fixture can exercise the generic generated resource-page surface without making renderer behavior part of the fixture contract. The Alice Bio pages are useful, and the sidecar fixture should consume the shared renderer improvements from [[wa.completed.2026.2026-05-03-resource-page-renderer-refresh]], but conformance for this fixture should focus on Semantic Flow artifacts, inventories, path policy, generated page presence, and raw RDF availability rather than pixel-level or prose-level presentation expectations.

- artifact landing pages exist for ontology and SHACL artifacts when those artifacts are integrated
- generated pages exist for current source bytes, versioned bytes, history pages, and support artifacts
- raw RDF rendering exists for `RdfDocument` pages, including ontology, SHACL, manifestation, and located-file pages where the bytes are locally available
- page generation remains rooted in shared runtime seams rather than fixture-specific HTML strings

For RDF documents, the page should let a reader inspect the actual triples without leaving the resource page. That can start as an escaped `<pre><code>` block or a progressively enhanced source panel. The important contract is that `RdfDocument` resource pages are not only metadata about a file; they also expose the RDF document content when Weave has local bytes. The raw file URL should still exist for tools and copy/download workflows.

The fourth question is URL presentation. Static hosting wants `ontology/index.html`, and browsers usually display `/ontology/`. The ontology IRI may be `/ontology` without a trailing slash. A small generated script could use `history.replaceState` to display the canonical IRI form after page load.

That script is worth exploring, but it has a trap: changing the displayed URL from `/ontology/` to `/ontology` can change how relative links resolve unless the page uses absolute/root-relative links or an explicit safe `<base>` URL. The task should therefore treat trailing-slash removal as a page-rendering feature with tests, not a quick snippet pasted into every page.

This task also intersects with the open layout question in [[sf.todo]]: `mesh-content/` probably should not remain a top-level sibling forever. For this sidecar fixture, mesh-owned helper content should start under `docs/_mesh/content/`.

### Alice Bio Precedent

The closest precedent is [[wa.completed.2026.2026-03-25-mesh-alice-bio]] together with the framework conformance task [[sf.completed.2026.2026-03-29-conformance-for-mesh-alice-bio]] and the examples index [[sf.api.examples]].

The reusable parts are:

- keep a numbered, human-readable branch ladder for manual inspection and comparison
- use branch pairs as test refs: apply the operation from the source branch, then compare the generated result to the destination branch under the transition manifest
- distinguish non-woven semantic-operation branches from `*-woven` branches
- treat `weave` as version, validate, and generate, not as integrate or mesh creation
- write one Accord manifest per transition, even when the filename follows the destination branch for convenience
- store conformance manifests in the framework examples tree, not in each fixture branch
- add manifests while the transition is being authored, so they stay normative instead of being reverse-engineered after the fact

For this fixture, the corresponding framework example area should be `semantic-flow-framework/examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/`, with API payloads under `api/` when needed and Accord manifests under `conformance/`.

The first ladder should be branch-based unless implementation pressure proves a generated-only fixture is more useful. A generated fixture can still be added later as a comparison output, but the hand-authored branch ladder is the reviewable design surface.

## Open Issues

- How should RDF datasets such as `examples/gunaar.ttl` declare the ontology version or compatibility line they were authored against?
- Should Semantic Flow define a small metadata property for dataset-to-ontology compatibility, or reuse an existing vocabulary pattern where the dataset announces the ontology artifact or ontology major version it expects?

## Decisions

- The fixture repository name should be `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`.
- The mesh root should be `docs/`.
- Creating `docs/` as a sidecar mesh root should be an expansion of `weave mesh create`, not a separate fixture-only scaffold command. The expected command shape is `weave mesh create --workspace . --mesh-root docs --mesh-base https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/`, where `--workspace` names the repo/workspace root and `--mesh-root` names the mesh location on disk inside that workspace.
- The `weave mesh create` CLI should resolve both `--workspace` and `--mesh-root` from the command working directory, then require the resolved mesh root to stay inside the resolved workspace root.
- `weave mesh create` should include `.nojekyll` by default for GitHub Pages publishing targets, with an explicit opt-out switch for users who do not want that file.
- The fixture should be fantasy-rules inspired, not a full rules ontology.
- The first carried domain should be tiny and stable: classes such as `AbilityScore`, `Alignment`, `Character`, and perhaps a small number of representative individuals or controlled values are enough.
- The SRD 5.2.1 PDF should be the initial source-reference boundary for rules vocabulary decisions. It is published under CC-BY-4.0 and requires attribution.
- The SRD 5.2 Markdown transcription can be used as a convenience source for source review and extraction, but the official SRD source and attribution statement remain authoritative.
- The fixture should avoid relying on trademarked branding or copied prose beyond what is intentionally and properly attributed from SRD 5.2.1.
- SRD attribution should live in `NOTICE.md`; ontology metadata should include source/provenance for SRD-derived vocabulary, but `dcterms:license` on the fantasy-rules ontology should identify the fantasy-rules ontology's own license, not the SRD license.
- The first-pass authored ontology, SHACL, and example files already exist in the fixture repo, so no separate source-authoring task note is needed before the sidecar mesh ladder proceeds.
- Use slash IRIs for ontology terms first, with term resources under ontology-root `ontology/...` paths such as `ontology/AbilityScore`. Hash-term support can be proven later.
- Use the authored Turtle prefix `fant:` for the fantasy-rules ontology namespace.
- The fixture should carry ontology and SHACL as separate artifacts with independent histories.
- Release paths should be artifact-local: `ontology/releases/v0.0.1` and `shacl/releases/v0.0.1`, not a single repo-global `releases/v0.0.1/...` path.
- The first release should use custom version path segments: ArtifactHistory `releases`, HistoricalState `v0.0.1`, and ArtifactManifestation `ttl`.
- The first ontology located file should be `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`, with the SHACL equivalent under `shacl/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl`.
- Version naming belongs on version/weave requests, not on generic targeting; unsupported custom segment requests should fail closed rather than silently producing default `_history001`, `_s0001`, or filename-derived manifestation paths.
- The default payload manifestation segment should migrate from filename-derived segments such as `fantasy-rules-ontology-ttl` to extension-derived segments such as `ttl`.
- The no-extension manifestation fallback still needs an implementation-level decision, but the normal RDF publishing path should be extension-backed by default.
- The Alice Bio ladder should be re-laddered for the extension-backed manifestation default rather than hidden behind fixture normalization.
- The first sidecar release should still request `manifestationSegment: "ttl"` explicitly until the default migration has landed everywhere, so this fixture does not depend on a half-migrated default.
- `dcterms:hasVersion` and `owl:versionIRI` should be deferred until the release/weave branch that materializes the target `HistoricalState` and versioned located Turtle bytes.
- Once release metadata is added, `dcterms:hasVersion` should point at the Semantic Flow `HistoricalState` and `owl:versionIRI` should point at versioned located Turtle bytes for OWL/RDF tool compatibility.
- Semantic Flow-specific release-state detail should be present in the mesh, but the authored ontology file should stay mostly normal OWL/RDF.
- If the meaning of a term needs to change, publish a new term instead of changing the meaning behind the existing IRI.
- Incompatible ontology changes should generally be treated as a new ontology artifact or compatibility line, not as a silent semantic rewrite of the same term set.
- Historical located files should be copied into the mesh by default when versioning is enabled.
- Use a numbered branch ladder for the hand-authored fixture, following the Alice Bio comparison pattern.
- The first sidecar ladder should continue past `07-shacl-integrated-woven` through ontology and SHACL term extraction, root/examples collection Knops, Gunaar example dataset integration, the first named ontology/SHACL release pair, and a follow-up version-bump pair.
- `10-root-knop` should add a friendly root Knop for the repository Resource Page and an `examples/` Knop to act as the collection surface for example datasets.
- `11-root-knop-woven` should weave the root and `examples/` collection Knops into history and pages before adding the Gunaar dataset.
- `12-gunaar-example-dataset` should integrate `examples/gunaar.ttl` as public artifact `examples/gunaar`; `13-gunaar-example-dataset-woven` should weave that dataset into history and pages.
- `14-first-release` and `15-first-release-woven` should publish the first named release histories for ontology and SHACL after the Gunaar dataset pair.
- `16-version-bump` and `17-version-bump-woven` should publish the next paired ontology and SHACL release under the existing `releases` ArtifactHistories with `stateSegment=v0.0.2`, should include a source change that proves extracted term pages are refreshed by the woven output, and should run source-scoped all-terms extraction for both ontology and SHACL after the `v0.0.2` source states exist.
- Ontology and SHACL should normally be bumped together in the fixture, even if only one source file has semantic changes, because they are published as a compatibility pair for this small ontology project.
- Named ArtifactHistory paths such as `releases` should not consume or advance `sflo:nextHistoryOrdinal`; that property remains the next auto-generated `_historyNNN` counter for the artifact.
- Semver-style HistoricalState paths such as `v0.0.1` should be explicitly requested and should not receive `sflo:stateOrdinal`; the containing named ArtifactHistory should still carry `sflo:nextStateOrdinal` for fallback default `_sNNNN` allocation if a later state request omits an explicit name.
- Once a payload history has established a named HistoricalState such as `v0.0.1`, later `weave` or `version` operations must fail closed when that payload would be versioned without an explicit next `stateSegment`. A caller may continue semver naming with `v0.0.2` or explicitly opt into ordinal fallback with a segment such as `_s0001`; Weave should not silently choose between those policies.
- Payload version segment defaults may apply broadly to all included payload artifacts, but target-specific segment fields should override the broad defaults. Support artifacts keep system-controlled history and state names until a separate support-artifact naming contract is defined.
- Because `weave extract --all-terms` now creates current-tracking term surfaces by default but still skips already registered Knops, the `17` extraction step should run after the `v0.0.2` weave and should also run `weave set extraction-source --all-terms` for the existing extracted ontology and SHACL terms. This makes the fixture explicitly migrate the older pinned `08/09` term inventories before proving already extracted pages refresh from current source RDF.
- The version-bump branch should include dataset compatibility metadata in `examples/gunaar.ttl` once the project settles how datasets announce the ontology version or compatibility line they target; do not block the first extracted-page refresh test on that still-open modeling decision.
- Use branch refs as test fixtures: source refs define operation input, destination refs define expected output, and Accord manifests define the transition assertions.
- Treat Accord manifests as transition contracts for the ladder, not as branch metadata or late acceptance paperwork.
- Store Fantasy Rules Sidecar conformance manifests in `semantic-flow-framework/examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/`.
- Author the first manifest for each transition as that transition settles, before a runner or generated fixture is allowed to define the expected behavior.
- Treat extracted term paths and source artifact designators as independent. `ontology/CharacterShape` intentionally remains under the ontology namespace while its source facts are pinned to the `shacl` artifact state whose Turtle uses the `fant:` prefix.
- Generated pages for extracted terms should load source-derived RDF facts through the term Knop's linked `_sources` extraction-source binding, not by inferring the source artifact from the term path prefix.
- Sidecar support should remain fail-closed. A `workingLocalRelativePath` outside the mesh root is allowed only when operational config explicitly permits that adjacent repo-local path.
- For this fixture, adjacent source allowances should be added when the corresponding sidecar artifact is integrated, not when the mesh is merely created. Those allowances should use the existing config ontology terms `sfcfg:MeshConfig` and `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule`, with `sfcfg:meshRootPathBase`, `sfcfg:workingLocalRelativePathLocatorKind`, and explicit `sfcfg:pathPrefix` values such as `../ontology/`, `../shacl/`, and, once example datasets are integrated, `../examples/`.
- The desired portable config surface should live under mesh-owned config such as `docs/_mesh/_config/`, not as a repo-root `.sf-repo-access.ttl` file.
- `weave mesh create` should create a mesh config support artifact at `_mesh/_config/config.ttl` when the caller specifies a workspace root that differs from the mesh root. For this sidecar fixture, that is `docs/_mesh/_config/config.ttl`.
- The sidecar `MeshConfig` should record `sfcfg:workspaceRootRelativeToMeshRoot "../"` for `--workspace . --mesh-root docs`, giving tools the portable relationship from mesh root to containing workspace root without recording an absolute host path.
- The sidecar `MeshConfig` produced by `weave mesh create` should grant no extra-mesh access. Constrained `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule` entries belong to later integration steps that actually introduce adjacent-source artifacts.
- Mesh-owned helper page content should live under `docs/_mesh/content/` in this fixture.
- Improved resource-page look-and-feel belongs to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-05-03-resource-page-renderer-refresh]]; this task should only depend on resource-page behavior needed for the sidecar fixture contract.
- `RdfDocument` resource pages should include raw RDF content when the document bytes are locally available.
- Knop support artifacts such as `KnopMetadata` and `KnopInventory` should use their declared `sflo:hasWorkingLocatedFile` or `sflo:workingLocalRelativePath` values to show current raw RDF on their generated resource pages; they should not need separate page-definition working-file metadata.
- The trailing-slash URL script should only run on generated resource pages whose canonical IRI is explicitly slashless, which is expected to include most resource pages. It must not break relative links, canonical links, copied IRI controls, or no-JavaScript page usability.
- Generated resource pages should preserve link behavior after slashless URL polish by using project-root-relative links for mesh navigation, resource pages, support assets, and local previews.

## Contract Changes

- Add or clarify a sidecar mesh creation/use contract where the mesh root is not the repository root.
- Expand `weave mesh create` so it separates the local workspace root from the mesh root path, can create a docs-rooted mesh surface, and keeps whole-repo meshes as the default `--mesh-root .` case.
- Expand `weave mesh create` so sidecar creation emits `_mesh/_config/config.ttl` support RDF with `sfcfg:workspaceRootRelativeToMeshRoot`, without seeding mesh-adjacent path grants.
- Include GitHub Pages `.nojekyll` defaults and an explicit opt-out in `weave mesh create`.
- Ensure `workingLocalRelativePath` can be resolved relative to a mesh root such as `docs/` while obeying explicit local path access policy.
- Use `MeshConfig` and `hasLocalPathAccessRule` from the Semantic Flow config ontology as the first-pass sidecar path-policy contract.
- Ensure weaving can copy historical snapshots from adjacent source files into mesh-owned release paths under `docs/`.
- Define expected artifact-local release path handling for non-ordinal histories such as `ontology/releases` and named states such as `v0.0.1`.
- Define version/weave request fields for custom ArtifactHistory, HistoricalState, and ArtifactManifestation path segments, including `releases`, `v0.0.1`, and `ttl`.
- Migrate the default manifestation-segment rule from filename-derived defaults to extension-derived defaults, while preserving explicit request overrides.
- Define the no-extension manifestation-segment fallback before making the extension-backed default normative.
- Define how ontology and SHACL artifacts advertise current working bytes, versioned located bytes, and generated resource pages in inventory.
- Define how example datasets such as `examples/gunaar.ttl` can advertise the ontology version or compatibility line they were authored against.
- Define the sidecar fixture's transition-manifest convention in the framework examples tree, reusing the Alice Bio one-manifest-per-transition approach.
- Define how branch refs, operation execution, and Accord manifests are combined into acceptance tests for the sidecar fixture.
- Define the resource-page behavior needed for ontology/SHACL landing pages, release pages, manifestation pages, and located-file pages, without making renderer-specific prose, layout, or visual styling part of sidecar fixture conformance.
- Define how `RdfDocument` resource pages obtain and render raw RDF bytes from current working files and historical located files.
- Defer shared page presentation/template improvements unless they are required for the sidecar fixture contract.
- Potentially introduce a generated page script contract for slashless canonical IRI URL display, including when it may call `history.replaceState` and how generated project-root-relative links remain safe.
- Decide whether mesh-owned helper page content should move from top-level `mesh-content/` to `_mesh`-owned content paths.

## Testing

- Add fixture-level Accord acceptance coverage for `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` as each branch transition is settled.
- Add branch-ref comparison tests that check out the source branch, run the intended operation or `weave`, and compare the resulting workspace to the destination branch under the matching Accord manifest.
- Add tests that run Weave against a workspace whose mesh root is `docs/`.
- Add tests proving `workingLocalRelativePath` can read explicitly allowed adjacent source files such as `../ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` and `../shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl`.
- Add fail-closed tests for disallowed `workingLocalRelativePath` traversal outside the configured repo-local boundary.
- Add tests proving woven release snapshots are materialized inside `docs/` and remain byte-identical to the source bytes for that release.
- Add tests proving custom version path segments produce `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/...` and `shacl/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/...`, not the ordinal or filename-derived defaults.
- Add tests for `owl:versionIRI` pointing to versioned located Turtle files.
- Add tests that generated resource pages link to current artifact pages, histories, states, manifestations, and located files without assuming a whole-repo mesh root.
- Add tests that `RdfDocument` resource pages include escaped raw RDF content from the correct current or historical located file.
- Add browser-oriented or HTML-level tests for the trailing-slash script if it lands, including relative-link behavior after `history.replaceState`.
- Keep visual/regression checks for the generated resource-page template baseline in the renderer task, not in the Fantasy Rules Sidecar fixture acceptance layer.

## Non-Goals

- Building a complete fantasy rules ontology.
- Modeling the full SRD 5.2.1.
- Modeling spells, monsters, equipment, classes, species, conditions, or combat systems in the first fixture.
- Making the fixture depend on URPX-specific terms or release policy.
- Replacing Alice Bio as the whole-repo reference mesh.
- Enabling arbitrary remote current-byte fetching.
- Treating `workingAccessUrl` or `targetAccessUrl` as live fetch inputs unless a separate operational-policy slice explicitly enables them.
- Making the generated resource pages a full client-side app.
- Requiring JavaScript for dereferenceability or basic navigation.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Fixture Shape, Ladder, And Source Policy

- [x] Confirm the first public base IRI for `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`.
- [x] Draft the small first ontology slice around `AbilityScore`, `Alignment`, `Character`, and representative controlled values or examples.
- [x] Review SRD 5.2.1 source for the small seed slice and defer larger SRD modeling.
- [x] Plan the SRD CC-BY-4.0 attribution boundary for `NOTICE.md` and choose source/provenance metadata for the ontology.
- [x] Use slash IRIs for first-pass ontology terms.
- [x] Draft the initial numbered branch ladder through `07-shacl-integrated-woven`, preserving the Alice Bio distinction between non-woven operation branches and `*-woven` branches.
- [x] Create the first `semantic-flow-framework/examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/README.md` plan before the first non-seed transition is treated as settled.
- [x] Define the branch-ref testing loop for source branch, operation execution, destination branch, and Accord manifest comparison.
- [x] Put first-pass mesh-owned helper page content under `docs/_mesh/content/`.

### Phase 1: Build Out The Sidecar Fixture Repo

- [x] Initialize or update `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` as the sidecar fixture repo.
- [x] Add authored ontology source under `ontology/`.
- [x] Add authored SHACL source under `shacl/`.
- [x] Add a first-pass example under `examples/`.
- [x] Add `NOTICE.md` with the SRD 5.2.1 CC-BY-4.0 attribution boundary.
- [x] Expand `weave mesh create` so `--workspace . --mesh-root docs --mesh-base https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/` creates the docs-rooted mesh support surface.
- [x] Add `.nojekyll` from `weave mesh create` by default for GitHub Pages publishing targets, with an opt-out switch.
- [x] Have `weave mesh create` create sidecar mesh-owned config at `docs/_mesh/_config/config.ttl` with `sfcfg:workspaceRootRelativeToMeshRoot "../"`.
- [x] Author the `01-source-only` to `02-sidecar-mesh-created` Accord manifest before generating the branch output.
- [x] Generate the `02-sidecar-mesh-created` fixture branch by running the current docs-rooted `weave mesh create` command from `01-source-only`.
- [x] Verify the generated `02-sidecar-mesh-created` branch output against the transition manifest.
- [x] Make `weave`, `weave validate`, `weave version`, and `weave generate` resolve from a mesh root, infer workspace root from mesh config when present, and otherwise treat the mesh root as the workspace root.
- [x] Add the first mesh-support-only weave transition so `02-sidecar-mesh-created` can produce the `03-sidecar-mesh-created-woven` current support ResourcePages without requiring an application Knop or payload candidate, including the sidecar config support artifact when present.
- [x] Make existing-mesh CLI operations mesh-root centered: use `--mesh-root` for operations after mesh creation, infer workspace root from mesh config, and keep `--workspace` only on `weave mesh create`.

### Phase 2: Integrate Ontology And SHACL Artifacts

- [x] Add an explicit `weave integrate --grant-source-directory` path so sidecar artifact integration can add the corresponding constrained mesh-carried source-directory rule while keeping ungranted extra-mesh source access fail-closed.
- [x] Integrate the ontology artifact at public path `ontology`.
- [x] Add the constrained `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule` entry for `../ontology/` as part of ontology artifact integration.
- [x] Integrate the SHACL artifact at public path `shacl`.
- [x] Ensure SHACL integration adds the constrained `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule` entry for `../shacl/`; the grant should be created by the integration operation that introduces the adjacent SHACL source artifact.
- [x] Add the constrained `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule` entry for `../examples/` only when example datasets are integrated as sidecar artifacts.
- [x] Use `workingLocalRelativePath` to associate the ontology artifact with its adjacent authored source file.
- [x] Use `workingLocalRelativePath` to associate the SHACL artifact with its adjacent authored source file.
- [x] Keep `hasWorkingLocatedFile` usage semantically consistent with the current located-byte story.
- [x] Add current resource pages for root, ontology, and relevant support artifacts.
- [x] Add current resource pages for SHACL and relevant support artifacts.
- [x] Add the Accord manifest for the ontology integration transition.
- [x] Add Accord manifests for the remaining SHACL integration transitions as they settle.

### Phase 3: Weave The First Release

- [x] Complete `10-root-knop`, including a root Knop and an `examples/` collection Knop, before the first named release pair.
- [x] Weave the root and `examples/` collection Knops in `11-root-knop-woven`.
- [x] Integrate the Gunaar example dataset at public path `examples/gunaar` in `12-gunaar-example-dataset`.
- [x] Ensure Gunaar dataset integration adds the constrained `sfcfg:hasLocalPathAccessRule` entry for `../examples/`; the grant should be created by the integration operation that introduces the adjacent example source artifact.
- [x] Use `workingLocalRelativePath` to associate the Gunaar dataset artifact with `../examples/gunaar.ttl`.
- [x] Weave the Gunaar dataset in `13-gunaar-example-dataset-woven`.
- [x] Weave ontology release `v0.0.1` under `ontology/releases/v0.0.1`.
- [x] Weave SHACL release `v0.0.1` under `shacl/releases/v0.0.1`.
- [x] Treat ontology and SHACL release bumps as a pair in the fixture, even when only one source file changes.
- [x] Materialize Turtle manifestations under each release state using the `ttl` manifestation segment.
- [x] Exercise multiple ArtifactHistories by creating or selecting the named `releases` history while preserving earlier ordinal publication histories.
- [x] Ensure `owl:versionIRI` points at the versioned located Turtle file.
- [x] Ensure working source bytes and latest historical located bytes match where the release is current.
- [x] Add Accord manifests for the first ontology and SHACL release/weave transitions as they settle.

### Phase 3B: Version-Bump Follow-Up Pair

- [ ] Add `16-version-bump` and `17-version-bump-woven` as the follow-up ontology and SHACL version-bump pair after the first release ladder is working.
- [ ] In `16-version-bump`, update the authored ontology and SHACL sources with `v0.0.2` release metadata, at least one changed term that already has an extracted page, and at least one new mesh-scoped term that all-terms extraction should discover.
- [ ] In `17-version-bump-woven`, weave the paired `v0.0.2` ontology and SHACL releases first, then run `weave extract --all-terms --source ontology --accept-preview`, `weave extract --all-terms --source shacl --accept-preview`, `weave set extraction-source --all-terms --source ontology --accept-preview`, and `weave set extraction-source --all-terms --source shacl --accept-preview`, and then regenerate/weave pages as needed.
- [ ] Use the follow-up pair to prove extracted term pages update when their source RDF changes by migrating the existing pinned term inventories to current-tracking source resolution before page generation.
- [ ] Use the follow-up pair to test how datasets, ontology files, SHACL files, release histories, extracted term pages, and generated pages behave when only part of the source content has semantic changes but the published compatibility pair advances together.
- [ ] Use the follow-up pair to prove broad payload state naming for ontology and SHACL together, such as one request-level/default state segment applied to both selected payload artifacts.

### Phase 3C: Explicit Return To Ordinal Sequencing

- [ ] Add a later pair for explicitly returning from named release state sequencing to default ordinal state or history sequencing.
- [d] Defer the previously considered immediate ordinal-return branch pair; `16/17` are now reserved for the version-bump pair.
- [ ] Alternatively use a named-history state fallback pair if the more important behavior is explicitly requesting `stateSegment=_s0001` under the existing `releases` history.
- [x] Keep this pair explicit; a broad weave with omitted state naming after `v0.0.1` should fail closed with a message explaining how to provide `stateSegment` or choose ordinal fallback.

Settled API/CLI surface: there is no separate "return to ordinal sequencing" command. The operator uses the existing payload version naming fields on `weave` or `weave version`. To continue semver in the current named history, provide `stateSegment=v0.0.2`. To explicitly fall back to ordinal states inside the current `releases` history, provide `stateSegment=_s0001`. To start a fresh ordinal history after `releases`, provide `historySegment=_history002`; if no state segment is supplied for that new history, the default state is `_s0001`, though the fixture may choose to pass `stateSegment=_s0001` as documentation-by-command. Request-level defaults such as `--payload-state-segment _s0001` and `--payload-history-segment _history002` may apply broadly to selected payload artifacts, while target-specific `historySegment` and `stateSegment` values override those defaults.

### Phase 4: Resource Page Behavior

- [d] Keep the target page model for ontology and SHACL artifact pages in the renderer task unless the sidecar fixture exposes a missing Semantic Flow behavior requirement.
- [d] Defer broader resource-page look-and-feel improvements to [[wa.completed.2026.2026-05-03-resource-page-renderer-refresh]].
- [x] Keep current artifact pages sufficient to show identity, current bytes, histories, and support resources for the fixture contract.
- [x] Show every `sflo:hasArtifactHistory` on artifact pages, not only `sflo:currentArtifactHistory`, ordered with the current/latest history first so named `releases` histories do not hide earlier ordinal histories.
- [x] Keep historical-state and located-file pages sufficient for navigating existing woven history without reading raw Turtle first.
- [x] Add raw RDF panels to `RdfDocument` resource pages for locally available current and historical bytes.
- [x] Move reusable page HTML/CSS rendering toward shared runtime seams rather than fixture-specific builders.
- [x] Add generic History-section truncation for repeated lists longer than 10 items: show the first 2 and last 7 with a vertical ellipsis gap marker.
- [d] Add or update specs for resource-page presentation in the renderer task if that contract changes materially.
- [d] Do not make renderer-specific prose, layout, or visual expectations part of Fantasy Rules Sidecar Accord manifests.

### Phase 5: URL Polish Experiment

- [x] Design the canonical-IRI display script for generated `index.html` pages.
- [x] Require an explicit canonical IRI signal before trimming a trailing slash.
- [x] Preserve relative-link behavior with root-relative/absolute links or an explicit safe `<base>` strategy.
- [x] Keep pages usable with JavaScript disabled.
- [x] Add tests for slashful load URL, slashless displayed URL, canonical link, and link navigation.

Settled behavior: `sflo:meshBase` stays trailing-slash for RDF and URL resolution, while generated resource-page canonical links use slashless resource IRIs where the resource path is slashless, including the mesh repo root page. The default page script reads the explicit canonical link and only calls `history.replaceState` when the current slashful path exactly matches the canonical slashless path, with no query or hash. Generated mesh navigation links remain root-relative, so link behavior survives URL polish and pages remain usable with JavaScript disabled.

Root resource-page titles and visible root designator labels should use the mesh segment, such as `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`, when Weave can derive it from `sflo:meshBase`; bare `/` remains an input/path sentinel, not the default public label.

### Phase 6: Acceptance And Documentation

- [x] Add Weave integration/e2e tests for docs-rooted sidecar operation.
- [ ] Migrate the default manifestation segment derivation to extension-backed segments and re-ladder `mesh-alice-bio` for the new default.
- [ ] Update [[wu.repository-options]] if the fixture changes the sidecar recommendation.
- [x] Update [[wd.codebase-overview]] once implementation lands.
- [ ] Update [[wd.decision-log]] with settled sidecar, release-path, and resource-page decisions before closing the task.
