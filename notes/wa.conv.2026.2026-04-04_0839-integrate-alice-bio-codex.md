integrate alice bio

Let's answer the open issues in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]] and then start implementation.

Regarding wd.spec, we've been creating other spec notes, do you think we should should change course? I think the CLI surface needs at least an explicit source path and deignator path. I'm interested how we'll resolve the "filesystem is separate" tension for core... which reminds me, integrate should eventually be able to take a remote File URL too.

Not sure what the debate is for thinness of the request/result examples. What are you thinking?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0838_51

I’m reviewing the task note, product vision, and the core developer guidance first so I can answer the open design questions against the repo’s actual constraints, then I’ll wire the first implementation slice.

I’ve got the task framing. Next I’m pulling the testing posture, ontology summary, and the current `weave` implementation/tests so the `integrate` design lands in the same shapes instead of inventing a parallel path.

The codebase view is consistent with the note: `integrate` belongs in shared `core`/`runtime`, and the acceptance target already exists. I’m reading the current command wiring and fixture helpers now so I can answer the CLI/API questions against what the repo already does.

The command entrypoint lives under `src/main.ts`/`src/cli/run.ts`, not `src/cli/main.ts`. I’m opening the current core/runtime/test files now and then I’ll commit the integrate shape into the task note before editing code.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0839_21

I’ve confirmed the current pattern: pure-ish planner in `core`, filesystem/materialization in `runtime`, and CLI just does argument shaping plus logging. I’m checking the existing `mesh create`/`knop create` request-result examples and the Alice fixture manifest so the new `integrate` slice matches that grain instead of overdesigning it.

I’ve got enough context to lock the first design choices. Before editing, I’m diffing the actual `05 -> 06` fixture so the planner emits exactly the proved surface and nothing speculative.

The fixture diff settles the first slice cleanly: `integrate` is just three RDF file changes and no page/history work. That pushes me to a narrow dedicated spec note rather than “no prose,” because this is now a distinct externally visible operation boundary, not just an implementation detail of the Alice fixture.

Plan from here:

1. Write a dedicated `wd.spec.*` note for `integrate` and resolve the task-note open issues around CLI and API shape.
2. Add tests first around a narrow core planner and the `05 -> 06` local runtime/CLI transition.
3. Implement `integrate` as a separate core/runtime/CLI slice where:
   - the CLI requires an explicit `designatorPath` plus an explicit local `--source`
   - runtime resolves that source into a mesh-relative working file path
   - core only plans semantic/filesystem surface changes from `designatorPath + workingFilePath`, so later `file:` or remote URL staging can slot in without putting host paths into the core contract.

I’m editing the task and spec notes now to lock the boundary before touching code. The key call is that host paths stay out of `core`; only the local runtime/CLI deals with a `--source` path or `file:` URL and turns it into a mesh-relative working file path.

The design boundary is now in the notes. Next I’m writing the failing `integrate` unit, runtime, and CLI tests against the settled `05 -> 06` manifest before I implement the command.

I’m adding the failing tests now. They lock three boundaries: exact `05 -> 06` file output, no rewriting of `alice-bio.ttl`, and no leaking a host-path contract into `core`.

I’ve got the test targets pinned. Now I’m wiring the actual `integrate` planner, runtime executor, and CLI command to match the fixture exactly, with the runtime doing the local source resolution and the core only seeing the mesh-relative working file path.

The first implementation is in place. I’m running the targeted `integrate` tests now to shake out exact fixture mismatches and any command wiring errors before I update the framework examples.

The first test run only surfaced plumbing issues, not a semantic mismatch: one unit test still had the wrong call shape, and the CLI acceptance test was missing `assertRejects`. I’m correcting those and rerunning.

The previous run only failed because I used bare `deno test` without the repo’s required permissions. I’m rerunning with the same flags the repo’s `deno task test` uses so we see actual behavior mismatches instead of sandbox noise.

The local slice is passing. I’m updating the thin framework contract next with the narrowest useful `integrate` shape: mesh target, one `designatorPath`, one `sourceUri`, and a generic created/updated result.

I’m patching the framework side now. The public example is intentionally not a copy of the local CLI: it uses a semantic `sourceUri`, not a host path, so we preserve the “filesystem is an implementation detail” boundary while still making `integrate` concrete.

The code and framework example are aligned now. I’m doing the repo-local bookkeeping next: updating the implementation note checkboxes, the current codebase overview, and the decision log so this slice is actually recorded as the new carried state.

I’ve finished the note updates. I’m running the repo formatter now, then I’ll run check and the full test task so we know this slice is clean against the repo’s normal validation path.

The integrate tests are green. I’m doing one last full repo `ci` pass so the close-out is based on the same path the branch would use, not just the targeted slice tests.

The Weave repo is clean from a validation standpoint. I also changed the nested `semantic-flow-framework` checkout for the thin `integrate` examples/spec, so I’m checking that repo’s status separately before I wrap up.

A dedicated `integrate` spec was the right call, so I did not change course on `wd.spec.*`. I added [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior]] and resolved the open questions in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]]. The first local CLI is `weave integrate <designatorPath> --source <path-or-file-url>` in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts). Runtime resolves that local source into a mesh-relative working file path in [integrate.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts), and `core` plans only from `designatorPath + workingFilePath` in [integrate.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/integrate/integrate.ts), which is the clean answer to the filesystem-separation tension. For now, the local runtime only accepts sources already inside the workspace or equivalent `file:` URLs; later remote staging can slot into runtime without changing the core contract.

The implementation and coverage are in [integrate.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/integrate/integrate.ts), [integrate.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts), [integrate_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/integrate/integrate_test.ts), [integrate_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/integrate_test.ts), and [integrate_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/integrate_cli_test.ts). On the thin public example question, I kept it narrow: mesh target, one `designatorPath`, one `sourceUri`, and generic `created`/`updated` results. Those changes are in the nested framework checkout at [[sf.api]], [semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/semantic-flow-api-spec.yaml), [integrate-job-request.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/integrate-job-request.jsonld), and [integrate-job-succeeded.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/api/integrate-job-succeeded.jsonld).

Verification: `deno task ci` passed in `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave`. I left the existing Kato-generated conversation/config artifacts alone.

commit mesg

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0851_08

For `weave`:

```text
feat(integrate): carry first local alice bio integrate slice

- add shared core/runtime `integrate` planning and execution for the settled `05` -> `06` Alice Bio transition
- add local `weave integrate <designatorPath> --source <path-or-file-url>` CLI support
- keep host filesystem paths out of shared core by resolving sources to mesh-relative working file paths in runtime
- add unit, integration, and black-box CLI acceptance coverage for the first integrate slice
- add an `integrate` behavior spec and update the task, decision log, and codebase overview notes
```

For the nested `semantic-flow-framework` repo, this should be a separate commit:

```text
feat(api): add thin integrate job examples

- add Alice Bio `integrate` request and succeeded job example payloads
- document `integrate` as the fourth concrete carried public operation example
- extend the thin API schema so `IntegrateJobRequest` carries `designatorPath` and `sourceUri`
```

I would keep the Kato conversation/config file changes out of these commits.

# User_2026-04-04_0854_52

The cli "weave integrate" command landed a little unintuitively. It reads like you're integrating the designatorPath. I would expect the source to be the default argument, and the designatorPath to be the second or flagged argument. Perhaps the designatorPath would get surmised if not provided, or in an interactive mode, you provide the designator path and a suggested one might be the default.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0855_09

I agree. The current `weave integrate <designatorPath> --source ...` shape is semantically clean for `core`, but it is not the best CLI.

At the CLI, the thing the user is acting on is the source artifact, so I would flip it:

- `weave integrate <source> --designator-path <path>`
- optionally allow `weave integrate <source> <designatorPath>` as shorthand
- for `--interactive`, prompt for `designatorPath` with a suggested default

I would not silently infer `designatorPath` in non-interactive mode unless the derivation rule is very explicit and narrow. Minting the wrong identifier is worse than making the user type one flag.

So the split I’d recommend is:

- `core`/public contract: keep `designatorPath` primary
- local CLI: make `source` the primary positional
- interactive mode: allow suggested `designatorPath`, but keep user confirmation

That is a good change, and it is CLI-only. The runtime/core boundary I added can stay as-is.

If you want, I can patch the command surface now to this shape.

# User_2026-04-04_0856_06

yes please.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0856_20

I’m changing the CLI surface only: `integrate` should take the source as the primary positional input and move `designatorPath` behind an explicit option. I’ll update the command wiring, the black-box CLI test, and the notes that currently freeze the old spelling.

I found the current hard-coded spelling in the CLI test and integrate notes. I’m patching those to `weave integrate <source> --designator-path <path>`, and I’m keeping inference out of non-interactive mode for now so we don’t quietly mint the wrong identifier.

I’m updating the command to accept `source` as the primary positional and `designatorPath` as either a second positional or `--designator-path`. I’m also making conflicting duplicates fail closed instead of guessing.

The parser change is in. Next I’m moving the acceptance test to the new spelling and updating the spec/task/decision wording so the docs stop freezing the old shape.

I’ve updated the public spelling. I’m doing one small cleanup pass now so the remaining error text also matches the new CLI contract instead of still talking about `--source`.

The contract text is aligned. I’m running formatting plus a full `ci` pass because this was a CLI parser change, and those are cheap to verify end to end here.

`integrate` now reads the way you described. In [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts) the CLI takes `source` as the primary positional and accepts `designatorPath` either as a second positional or via `--designator-path`, so both of these work:

```bash
weave integrate alice-bio.ttl alice/bio
weave integrate alice-bio.ttl --designator-path alice/bio
```

I updated the black-box CLI test in [integrate_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/integrate_cli_test.ts) and the integrate notes in [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior]], [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]], and [[wd.decision-log]]. I did not add silent inference or interactive prompting yet; the command still requires an explicit designator path to avoid minting the wrong identifier.

Verification: `deno task ci` passed.

# User_2026-04-04_0857_47

instead of "--designator-path" maybe we should keep consistent with the ontology, i.e. designatorPath?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0857_58

I would keep `--designator-path` in the CLI.

`designatorPath` is the right ontology/API property name. CLI flags are a different surface, and kebab-case is the normal shell spelling. Mixing camelCase into flags makes the CLI feel less native for very little gain.

Clean split:

- ontology / RDF / JSON-LD / shared request types: `designatorPath`
- CLI flag in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts): `--designator-path`

If you want, a reasonable compromise is:

- document `--designator-path`
- also accept `--designatorPath` as an alias for convenience

But I would not make camelCase the primary CLI spelling.

# User_2026-04-04_0858_54

keep as is. 

is designator path optional?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0859_01

No. In the current slice, `designatorPath` is still required.

What changed is only how it is supplied on the CLI: the source is now the primary positional, and `designatorPath` can be given either as the second positional argument or with `--designator-path` in [run.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/cli/run.ts). The behavior spec also still marks it as required in [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior]].

So these are valid:

```bash
weave integrate alice-bio.ttl alice/bio
weave integrate alice-bio.ttl --designator-path alice/bio
```

This is not valid yet:

```bash
weave integrate alice-bio.ttl
```

I kept inference and interactive suggestion out for now.

# User_2026-04-04_0946_19

I posted some coderabbit review comments under "## coderabbit review". Please analyze, add checkboxes for the ones that should be done, and [c] for ones not worth doing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0946_31

I’m reading the task note’s `## coderabbit review` section and the nearby implementation context, then I’ll mark each item as actionable `[ ]` or canceled `[c]` with the reasoning grounded in the current code and slice boundaries.

I’ve got the review items. I’m checking the actual `integrate` runtime code now so I can sort each one into “worth doing” versus “not worth doing” instead of just transcribing CodeRabbit.

I’ve sorted them. Only the logger-preservation item rises to “should do” for this task; the others are either low-value polish or broader cleanup that should not be smuggled into this slice as integrate-only churn.

I updated the `## coderabbit review` section in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]].

I marked only one item as actionable:

- `[ ]` preserve a single explicitly provided logger in `resolveLoggers`

I canceled the others:

- `[c]` `describeIntegrateResult` wording polish
- `[c]` async conversion of `assertUpdatedTargetsExist`
- `[c]` regex-to-RDF parsing for `meshBase` extraction in this task

The main reason is that only the logger item is a real correctness issue inside this slice. The others are either low-value nits or broader cross-runtime cleanup that should not be done as an integrate-only tweak.

No tests ran, since this was a task-note update only.

# User_2026-04-04_0953_46

Fix the logger.

I've created [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] -- please fill that out with all the locations we should replace regex with RDF-aware parsing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_0953_58

I’m fixing the integrate logger bug first, then I’m surveying the codebase for RDF-related regex extraction so the new parsing task note is concrete rather than hand-wavy.

I’ve identified the first-pass regex/string parsing hotspots. I’m reading the blank RDF parsing task note template context and then I’ll patch in a concrete inventory of every production location that should move to RDF-aware parsing, grouped by priority.

I’m fixing the logger with a regression test, not just the implementation. After that I’ll fill the RDF parsing task note with the actual production call sites, grouped by the kind of parsing debt.

The logger issue is copy-pasted, not integrate-specific. I’m fixing the same `resolveLoggers` bug across the local runtime entrypoints so we don’t leave the exact defect in `mesh create`, `knop create`, and `weave` one file away.

I’m centralizing logger resolution in the logging factory and adding a unit test there. That fixes the bug once instead of carrying four slightly different copies.

The logger fix is patched. I’m filling the RDF parsing task note now with the full production inventory: runtime loaders first, then weave candidate discovery, then the line-oriented Turtle mutation helpers in `core`.

The code fix is in. I’m marking the logger review item complete in the integrate task note, then I’ll run formatter and CI because the change touched shared runtime entrypoints.

I fixed the logger bug by centralizing partial-logger preservation in [factory.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/factory.ts) via `resolveRuntimeLoggers(...)`, then switched the local runtime entrypoints to use it in [create.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/mesh/create.ts), [create.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/knop/create.ts), [integrate.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts), and [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts). I did it across all four because the bug was copy-pasted, not integrate-specific. There’s also a regression test now in [logger_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/logger_test.ts), and I marked the CodeRabbit logger item complete in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-integrate-alice-bio]].

I also filled out [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] with the current production RDF-parsing debt, grouped by priority. It now covers:
- runtime `meshBase` regex extraction in `knop create`, `integrate`, and `weave`
- runtime `weave` Knop discovery and woven-state checks
- string-fragment shape assertions in `src/core/weave/weave.ts`
- line-oriented `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` mutation in `src/core/knop/create.ts` and `src/core/integrate/integrate.ts`

Verification: `deno task fmt && deno task ci` passed.

# User_2026-04-04_1020_09

Two more coderabbit comments. Worth doing?

"Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

Inline comments:
In `@src/runtime/logging/logger_test.ts`:
- Around line 43-58: The tests use structural equality (assertEquals) to check
that resolveRuntimeLoggers returns the exact provided logger instances; change
those assertions to strict identity checks by replacing assertEquals with
assertStrictEquals for the comparisons involving providedOperational and
providedAudit (specifically the assertions in resolveRuntimeLoggers test that
check withOperationalOnly.operationalLogger, withAuditOnly.auditLogger,
withBoth.operationalLogger, and withBoth.auditLogger) so the test verifies
reference preservation rather than structural equality.

---

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/runtime/logging/factory.ts`:
- Around line 55-60: The current resolveRuntimeLoggers eagerly calls
createRuntimeLoggers() into defaults even when options.operationalLogger and
options.auditLogger are provided; change it to only call createRuntimeLoggers()
when one or both loggers are missing: in resolveRuntimeLoggers first check if
both options.operationalLogger and options.auditLogger are present and return
them directly, otherwise call createRuntimeLoggers() once and use its
operationalLogger/auditLogger to fill any missing values before returning the
object."

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1020_18

I’m checking the current implementations of the new logger helper and test so I can sort those two comments into real fixes versus noise.

**Findings**

- Low: [logger_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/logger_test.ts#L43) should use `assertStrictEquals` for the four logger-instance assertions. The intent of that test is reference preservation, and `assertEquals` checks structural equality instead. That weakens the regression test.
- Nit: [factory.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/factory.ts#L55) should avoid eagerly calling `createRuntimeLoggers()` when both loggers were already provided. It is not a correctness bug today, but it is unnecessary allocation and makes the helper less honest about its control flow.

Recommendation: both are worth doing, but not equally. The `assertStrictEquals` change is the stronger one because it fixes the test to assert the actual contract. The eager-defaults change is cheap and reasonable to fold in at the same time, but I would treat it as cleanup, not as a substantive bug.

No code changes made here, and no tests ran.

# User_2026-04-04_1022_20

do both please

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1022_23

I’m patching both logger follow-ups now: tighten the test to identity checks and make `resolveRuntimeLoggers` lazy when both loggers are already present. Then I’ll rerun the repo validation path.

The logger helper and test are updated. I’m running `fmt` and `ci` now since this is shared runtime code and the repo-wide path is cheap enough to use as the verification gate.

Both are done.

I changed [factory.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/factory.ts) so `resolveRuntimeLoggers` returns early when both loggers are already provided, and only calls `createRuntimeLoggers()` when one is missing. I also tightened the regression test in [logger_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/logging/logger_test.ts) to use `assertStrictEquals` for the provided logger instances, so it now checks identity rather than structural equality.

Verification: `deno task fmt && deno task ci` passed.

# User_2026-04-04_1024_18

one more: In `@tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts`:
- Around line 23-27: The function resolveMeshAliceBioConformanceManifestPath
currently builds the path with a template literal; change it to use path.join
for cross-platform separators and consistency with other helpers: update
resolveMeshAliceBioConformanceManifestPath to call path.join(frameworkRepoPath,
'examples', 'alice-bio', 'conformance', manifestName) and add/import the Node
path module (e.g., import { join } from 'path' or use path.join) if not already
present so the function returns a properly joined filesystem path.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1024_24

I’m checking the fixture helper now. This one is trivial and low-risk, so I’ll just patch it and run the relevant validation path instead of debating it.

The helper already imports `join`, so this is just a small cleanup to make the manifest path construction consistent with the rest of the file. I’m patching it and then I’ll run the repo validation path.

Done. [mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts) now uses `join(...)` in `resolveMeshAliceBioConformanceManifestPath(...)` instead of a template literal.

Verification: `deno task fmt && deno task ci` passed.

# User_2026-04-04_1226_37

i think we need the next task note?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1229_45

I’m checking the active/completed task notes and the carried fixture ladder so the next note lands on the actual next slice, not just the next empty filename.

The integrate task is materially complete, so the next useful note is the next carried semantic slice, not another cleanup note. I’m drafting the `06 -> 07` woven task against the existing weave behavior spec and the settled fixture ladder.

I’ve got enough context. I’m writing the next carried-slice note for `06-alice-bio-integrated` -> `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven`, reusing the existing weave behavior spec and the settled 07 manifest as the acceptance target.

Yes. I wrote the next carried-slice note at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]].

It frames the next implementation as `06-alice-bio-integrated` -> `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven`, reuses [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]], and uses the settled `07` manifest as the acceptance target. I kept it narrow around payload history, payload-Knop histories, `_mesh/_inventory` advancement to `_s0003`, and the first `alice/bio` page surface.

No tests ran, since this was a note-only change.

# User_2026-04-04_1237_51

new chat?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1237_59

Yes.

This thread has now mixed:
- the `integrate` slice
- CLI shape adjustments
- CodeRabbit follow-ups
- logger cleanup
- the RDF parsing follow-up task
- the next `07` weave task note

A fresh chat is the cleaner move for implementation of [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]].

For the new chat, I’d start with:
- [[product-vision]]
- [[wd.general-guidance]]
- [[wd.testing]]
- [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]
- [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]]

And I would keep the RDF parsing note as adjacent follow-up context, not the main brief, unless you want to switch focus to that cleanup instead.

# User_2026-04-04_1249_48

What's next, [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] or [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]] ?

Open Issues:

"Does the current shared `weave` request shape stay narrow with `designatorPaths`, or does payload weaving reveal the need for a more explicit artifact-target model later?" Talk me through this one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1250_26

Next should be [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]], not [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]].

Reason:
- `06 -> 07` is the next carried semantic slice in the settled fixture ladder.
- it has a concrete acceptance target already in the `07` manifest
- it will tell us whether the current `weave` model still holds under payload history/page generation
- the RDF parsing task is important, but it is cross-cutting cleanup, not the next product behavior slice

If you want momentum on Weave-as-a-product, do `07` next. If `07` implementation runs into enough pain from regex/string parsing, then peel off the smallest necessary RDF parsing subtask during that work. I would not switch the main focus to the whole parsing task first.

On the open issue: the current shared `weave` request shape should stay narrow with `designatorPaths` for now.

In [src/core/weave/weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts), `WeaveRequest` is currently about selecting identifier-rooted work, not individual artifacts. That still fits `07` well. Asking to weave `alice/bio` should mean:

- weave the `alice/bio` payload artifact
- weave `alice/bio/_knop/_meta`
- weave `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory`
- advance `_mesh/_inventory` as needed
- generate the related current/history pages

That is exactly the semantic closure you want from high-level `weave`. In other words, payload weaving does not break `designatorPaths`; it actually confirms why it is the right high-level selector.

I would only introduce a more explicit artifact-target model later if one of these becomes real:

- you need to weave mesh-owned artifacts that do not belong to a `designatorPath`
- you need to target internal support artifacts independently of the owning identifier
- you want lower-level operations like “version only this artifact” or “generate only this page surface”
- one `designatorPath` stops being a coherent unit of weave work

If that happens, I would be inclined to keep high-level `weave` narrow and add a richer target model to lower-level operations like `version` or `generate`, not rush it into `weave` first.

So my recommendation is:

- proceed with `07` next
- keep `WeaveRequest.designatorPaths` as-is for this slice
- leave the artifact-target question open for later, but do not let it block implementation now

Everything can stay out of ResourcePage rendering for now, but likely we should pay some consideration around making ResourcePage generation "common code" that can be refactored into basically a semantically-aware SSG.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1410_30

I think that’s the right direction, with one constraint: don’t build the SSG yet.

For [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]], I’d frame it like this:

- keep `07` out of “real rendering system” work
- but make page generation land in shared runtime code, not as one-off inline HTML scattered through each operation
- treat that shared code as the first seam toward a semantic-aware SSG later

The important split is:

- semantic graph inspection and page-model derivation
- HTML rendering of those page models

If you keep those separate, later refactoring into an SSG is realistic. If `weave` keeps embedding operation-specific strings directly in planners, the refactor will be ugly.

So my recommendation is:

- for `07`, extract a small shared ResourcePage layer in `runtime`
- keep it minimal: page descriptors, shared path/IRI helpers, shared HTML shell
- do not introduce themes, content pipelines, template loaders, or “site build” abstractions yet

That gives you common code now without pretending you already have the final semantically-aware SSG.

If you want, I can patch the `07` task note to record exactly that as a decision/open-issue resolution.

# User_2026-04-04_1413_13

OK, sounds good. Please update the task, including a implementation todos for shared runtime page generation code. Or should that be a separate task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1413_19

I’m updating the `07` task note now. My recommendation is to keep the shared runtime page-generation seam inside this task, but explicitly narrow it to “common code for this slice,” not a separate SSG task.

# User_2026-04-04_1414_08

Are we not going to commonize code for pre-existing slices? separate task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1414_15

I’m checking the current `07` task note and the repo guidance so I can answer this in the task’s terms rather than hand-waving. After that I’ll tell you whether the commonization belongs inside `07` or in a separate cleanup task.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1414_23

I’m checking where the existing page-generation logic lives now. That will tell us whether the `07` task should opportunistically pull older slices into a shared seam, or whether that becomes cleanup work with different acceptance criteria.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1414_34

The current duplication is almost entirely in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts), not across all prior slices. I’m updating the `07` task note to make the intent explicit: `07` should introduce the shared page-generation seam and pull the existing render-bearing weave slice onto it, but not turn into a broad retrofit task.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1414_45

I’ve updated the task to make the boundary explicit. I’m grabbing the line references now so I can answer you precisely against the note rather than summarize from memory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1414_56

Not as a broad separate task, no.

What I updated in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L76]] is the narrower version:

- `07` should introduce the first shared runtime page-generation seam.
- That seam should absorb the existing render-bearing `05` weave slice too, so we do not leave two page-generation paths behind.
- It should not turn into a general retrofit across unrelated older slices.

That boundary is now explicit in the decisions and plan at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L91]] and [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L127]].

The practical reason is that the duplication is concentrated in the existing `weave` renderer code in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts), not spread across every prior semantic slice. So folding `05` into the new seam during `07` is good hygiene; spinning up a separate task for that alone would mostly create churn. If later we want a broader retrofit beyond current page generation, that would be a separate task.

No tests ran; this was a task-note update.

# User_2026-04-04_1419_09

OK, I will start in new task if you think we're ready.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1419_14

Yes. We’re ready for a new chat on [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]].

The task note now has the right boundary:
- `07` is the next carried slice
- `designatorPaths` stays narrow for now
- shared runtime page generation is included, but only enough to absorb current weave rendering and the new payload-facing pages

In the new chat, I’d start implementation from:
- [[product-vision]]
- [[wd.general-guidance]]
- [[wd.testing]]
- [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]]
- [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]]

Only note: the worktree still has the existing Kato note/config edits, which I left alone.
