I'd like to build out the Kato website.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1206_05

I’m going to inspect the repo structure and read the required developer guidance in `dev-docs/notes/dev.general-guidance.md` before deciding how to build out the website.

I’ve confirmed this is a Deno-first monorepo and that we should treat `apps/web` as the web surface. Next I’m reading the existing website task note and the current `apps/web` implementation to see whether this is an extension of the operator UI or a separate marketing/docs site.

There’s already a functional local web console under `apps/web`, but the current website task note is basically empty. I’m checking the existing landing route and prior website planning notes now so I can decide whether to extend `apps/web` or split a separate public site.

The earlier notes make an important distinction: `apps/web` is the local authenticated operator console, while the public product website was expected to be a separate site. I’m checking whether the current Fresh app can sensibly host a public front page without fighting the auth model, or whether we should scaffold a dedicated site project instead.

The codebase overview is explicit that `apps/web` is the local authenticated console. I’m treating the public website as a separate concern and checking the root tooling now so I can scaffold it without trampling the existing app boundaries.

The repo doesn’t have a public-site scaffold yet; the only website work so far is branding groundwork. I’m reading that branding/release context before I lock the visual direction and task note, so the first pass aligns with the product’s existing language instead of inventing a new brand from scratch.

`apps/web` is the wrong place for the public website. It is explicitly the authenticated local operator console, and reusing it for marketing/docs would blur the repo boundary and complicate auth behavior.

Plan for this first slice:
1. Turn the empty task note into a real implementation note with scope, decisions, testing, and checkbox plan.
2. Scaffold a separate public-site app in-repo, Deno-first, with its own dev/build tasks.
3. Build an initial landing page for Kato that reflects the existing product vision and README: headline, positioning, supported surfaces, quickstart/install, and links into the repo.
4. Add minimal docs/supporting content structure so this is a usable website rather than a single hero section.
5. Run targeted validation for the new site and update the architecture notes where the new public-site boundary matters.

I’ve got enough context to start editing. First I’m turning the empty task note into an actual contract for this work, then I’ll scaffold a separate public-site app with a concrete first pass at the landing/manual experience.

# User_2026-04-06_1217_36

I want to basically use the dendron notes at dev-docs/notes to build the website. Dendron already has a web publishing framework based on nextjs, see https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/FnK2ws6w1uaS1YzBUY3BR/ and https://github.com/dendronhq/nextjs-template but instead of publishing reasonable HTML files, it puts all the content into javascript and displays that. 

I want something more like a traditional SSG like Lume that takes in the markdown and generates actual pages. It has to support and use dendron-style hierarchy using periods in the filenames.

The site will have a "Development" section corresponding to the dev.* notes, a release-notes section. and a "User Guide" section corresponding to the docs.* , and "Contributors" section (currently only [[contributor.djradon]] ), and single pages for  roadmap and product-ideas.

I think we'll either need to heavily modify something like Lume, perhaps with a Lume plugin, or build from scratch. 

One major consideration is that "weave" also needs to build static pages, and we've previously rejected using Lume for that, but maybe we keep this "Dendron-based markdown notes generator" separate from the weave SSG. See /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.conv.2026.2026-03-14_0958-existing-solutions-that-could-be-extended-with-weave-codex.md for valuable context.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1217_55

I’m switching from a generic public-site scaffold to the actual constraint set you gave: build from `dev-docs/notes`, preserve Dendron semantics, and avoid the client-heavy Dendron Next.js output model. First I’m reading the official Dendron/Lume sources you linked plus the local Weave context so the implementation choice is based on the real integration surface, not guesswork.

The Dendron docs confirm the important pieces: the filenames are the hierarchy, and Dendron’s stock publish flow really does revolve around the Next.js template. I’m measuring the actual note syntax used in this repo now so I can target the smallest correct feature set instead of overbuilding a generic Dendron clone.

The actual repo usage is fairly narrow: plain Dendron wikilinks like `[[note]]` and `[[note#fragment]]`, plus the note hierarchy encoded in dot-delimited filenames. That keeps this tractable. I’m checking whether Kato already has reusable Dendron-link logic before I write a new site generator from scratch.

The repo already has the two reusable pieces we need: Dendron vault discovery from `dendron.yml`, and conservative note-target rewriting logic for `[[note]]` generation. I’m reading those modules now so the website generator can share the same Dendron rules instead of inventing a second, inconsistent interpretation.

The architecture choice is clear now: don’t bend `apps/web`, and don’t force Lume into being a Dendron compiler. I’m updating the plan to a bespoke Deno static generator that consumes the note vault directly and emits real HTML pages.

I’m editing the task note first to lock the scope: selected note sections only, custom Deno generator, real HTML output, and a deliberately narrow Dendron feature set for the first pass.

I’m writing the generator as small Deno modules under `scripts/site/`: one for note discovery/classification, one for markdown/link rendering, one for page layout. That keeps the logic testable and separate from the generated `docs/` output.

# User_2026-04-06_1229_15

I want to rename dev-docs to just docs since it has developer, user, and cross-purpose documentation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1229_33

I’m switching to the repo-wide folder rename. First I’m mapping the current `dev-docs` references and the worktree state so I can move the directory without trampling your in-progress note renames.

I’ve got the main impact map. I’m moving the folder now and then I’ll do a constrained repo-wide path update, avoiding conversation transcripts unless the path is part of live instructions or build/test behavior.

The folder move is done. I’m now updating the live references and build/test paths to `docs/...`, and I’m deliberately leaving raw conversation transcripts alone unless they’re part of current behavior or instructions.

The path rename is clean. I’m making one follow-up adjustment now: the in-progress website generator can no longer emit to `docs/`, because `docs/` is now the source vault. I’m moving that planned output target to a non-conflicting build directory.

The rename itself is independent, and the half-built site-generator files would just add unrelated noise to this change. I’m dropping that unfinished generator stub so the worktree stays focused on the `dev-docs` → `docs` rename.

The rename is in place and the live references are updated. I’m running a focused validation now: repo type-check plus the markdown-writer test slice whose fixtures explicitly use the docs path.

# User_2026-04-06_1231_28

Oops, sorry, not "docs" but "documentation". "docs" will be where the outputted site lives, to make it servable on github pages. 

Note that we do have existing image assets, /home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/shared/assets/2026-03_kato-logo_256_trans.png and [2026-03_kato-wordmark_v2_black-outline.png](shared/assets/2026-03_kato-wordmark_v2_black-outline.png)

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1231_43

That correction matters. I’m switching the source vault rename from `docs` to `documentation`, and I’ll leave `docs/` available for generated site output. I’m checking the in-flight validation first so I don’t rename the tree out from under a running command.

The previous validation exposed one path-sensitive test expectation, which is exactly the kind of thing this rename should flush out. I’m renaming `docs` to `documentation`, updating the remaining live references, and then I’ll fix that test to match the new repo path depth.

I’ve got the second rename done. Now I’m updating the source-vault references from `docs/...` to `documentation/...` while keeping `docs/` reserved as the future generated-site output path.

I’m fixing the remaining details now: one test expectation, the Dendron workspace labels, and the website task note so it matches your corrected split of `documentation/` for source and `docs/` for generated output.

I’m finishing the rename correction so the source vault is `documentation/` and `docs/` stays reserved for generated site output. I’m checking the remaining config and test fallout now, then I’ll patch those files and rerun the targeted validation.

I’ve narrowed the remaining fallout to config labels, one test expectation, and the website task note. I’m also doing one more grep pass for live path references so we don’t leave `docs/notes` lingering in executable config while `docs/` is reserved for output.

I’ve confirmed there aren’t any remaining live `dev-docs` or `docs/notes` references outside historical conversation notes. I’m patching the remaining config and task-note inconsistencies now, including locking the planned site output directory to `docs/` since that’s no longer an open question.

The remaining edits are in place: the Dendron workspace now identifies itself as `documentation`, the task note reflects `docs/` as the output target, and the broken test expectation is corrected for the new path layout. I’m rerunning validation now to make sure the rename settled cleanly.

The rename correction is clean: `documentation/` is the source vault, `docs/` remains open for generated output, and both the targeted test and full `deno task check --frozen` pass. I’m switching back to the actual website build now, starting with the existing workspace/Dendron utilities and the new task note so I can wire a generator into the repo instead of inventing a parallel path.

I’ve got the local constraints back in view: Deno-first tooling, task-note-first workflow, and an existing Dendron workspace helper we can build on. The next step is finding what markdown/frontmatter plumbing already exists so the site generator can reuse repo conventions instead of smuggling in a Node-centric stack.

I’m at the design fork now. The repo doesn’t already have a markdown-to-HTML pipeline, so the practical route is a small repo-specific Deno generator with its own tested helpers: note discovery/classification, hierarchy-aware URLs, Dendron wikilink rewriting, and HTML templates that write straight into `docs/`. I’m pulling in the surrounding site-related code and notes next so I can choose the smallest clean integration point.

# User_2026-04-06_1235_11

Git is showing the rename as deleting all the old files and creating new ones. Can we do the dev-docs rename more elegantly?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1235_54

I’m checking the cleanest Git-side fix now. The core issue is that a plain filesystem move leaves the worktree looking like `D` plus `??`; Git only starts showing renames once the move is reflected in the index, so I’m staging just the tracked `dev-docs` to `documentation` path pairs rather than sweeping in unrelated changes.

Yes. The clean way is to let Git see the move in the index.

I staged just the tracked `dev-docs -> documentation` path pairs, and `git status` now shows the bulk of that change as `R` rename entries instead of `D` plus `??`. I did not sweep in the unrelated top-level modified files.

What still shows separately is not the directory rename itself:
- the three old `review.*` notes versus the new `dev.review.*` notes
- the new `documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md`

Those are separate note-level renames/additions, not fallout from the folder move.

One important Git point: if the move is left purely unstaged, Git generally will not present it elegantly. A clean rename view requires staging or having used `git mv` up front. If you want, I can also pair and stage those three `review.* -> dev.review.*` note renames so the whole notes area reads more cleanly.

```text
refactor: rename dev-docs to documentation and reserve docs for site output

- move the Dendron source vault from dev-docs/ to documentation/
- keep docs/ available for generated static-site output and GitHub Pages
- update repo references and Dendron workspace/config paths to the new source location
- align the website task note with the new source/output directory split
- fix the markdown writer test expectation for the renamed vault layout
```

If you want, I can also give you a shorter one-line variant for a pure rename-only commit.

# User_2026-04-06_1242_38

At some point, I saw new .ts files under scripts/site. I guess you decided to go another route? I'm okay with making it a bunch of scripts right now, but eventually I'm going to want to productize it so keep that in mind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1243_04

Yes. I briefly started a `scripts/site/*` spike, then removed it when the directory rename became the real blocking change. Leaving half-committed generator scaffolding in the tree would have been noise.

Your instinct is right, though: scripts are fine as the bootstrap surface, but they should not become the architecture. I’ll treat them as thin entrypoints only, and keep the actual site logic in separable modules:
- note discovery/classification
- Dendron hierarchy and wikilink resolution
- markdown-to-HTML rendering
- page/layout generation
- output writing into `docs/`

That way we can start with `scripts/site/build.ts` now, but later lift the core into a proper reusable package or standalone “Dendron notes to static site” tool without rewriting it.

# User_2026-04-06_1258_23

One thing we haven't discussed is URL structure. Earlier dendron stuff re-used the filename as a URL slug. Then, to prevent link rot during file renaming, it started using the IDs. Which makes sense, except the IDs are currently random text. But the IDs CAN be anything, so maybe as a pre-work, we re-ID all the notes (or those in scope for the site) with the filename slug?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1258_44

I’m checking the current note metadata and how much of the repo already assumes Dendron `id` semantics before I answer, because the wrong choice here will either lock in ugly public URLs or make future renames brittle in a new way.

Yes, but not exactly the way you framed it.

The key distinction is: source filename, stable identity, and public URL should not all be the same thing. Random Dendron `id`s are bad public URLs. But `id = filename-slug` is only better if you freeze it forever; otherwise you just move the link-rot problem to a prettier string.

I’d use this model:

- Public URL: readable and hierarchical.
- Stable note key: permanent, machine-stable.
- Source filename: current Dendron note name, allowed to change later.

For example:

- `dev.general-guidance` -> `/development/general-guidance/`
- `docs.compatibility` -> `/user-guide/compatibility/`
- `release-notes.v0.2.11` -> `/release-notes/v0.2.11/`
- `roadmap` -> `/roadmap/`

My recommendation is:

- Do not use the current random `id`s in visible URLs.
- Do not use short bare slugs like `general-guidance` as IDs; collisions become likely.
- For published notes, seed a stable key from the current full note name, like `dev.general-guidance` or `docs.compatibility`.
- After that, treat that key as permanent even if the filename changes.

For productization, I slightly prefer adding a site-owned field like `canonicalId` or `publicId` rather than overwriting Dendron’s `id`. That keeps authoring-tool internals separate from the website contract. If you want the simpler route, repurposing `id` for in-scope notes is still workable, but then `id` becomes part of the product contract and should stop being “whatever Dendron generated.”

I would only migrate the notes that will actually be published, not conversations/tasks/completed/cancelled notes.

If you want, I can lock this into the website task note as the URL/identity contract and then add a migration script for the in-scope notes.

# User_2026-04-06_1305_43

I think a new ID, like publicId, is promising, but now I'm confused as to whether we need it or not. What needs to be permanent-ish is the URL, so basically the publicId will be the initial filename slug (with dot hierarchy) that will be used for URL generation, at least for in-scope pages? And then what happens when it's missing?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1306_25

Yes. If the goal is “URL stays stable even when the note filename changes,” then `publicId` is the cleanest contract.

The model should be:

- `id`: Dendron/internal note metadata. Leave it alone.
- `publicId`: canonical published identity for in-scope pages.
- URL: generated from `publicId`, not from the current filename.

Example:

```yaml
---
id: cta3nbz9egelrjz5ec86wxm
publicId: dev.general-guidance
---
```

Then the site generator can map that to:

- `dev.general-guidance` -> `/development/general-guidance/`
- `docs.compatibility` -> `/user-guide/compatibility/`
- `release-notes.v0.2.11` -> `/release-notes/v0.2.11/`
- `roadmap` -> `/roadmap/`

So yes: for published notes, `publicId` would usually be initialized from the current filename slug, including the dot hierarchy, and then treated as permanent-ish.

What happens when it’s missing:

- For out-of-scope notes: nothing. They are unpublished, so no `publicId` needed.
- For in-scope notes during migration/bootstrap: compute it from the filename and warn.
- For in-scope notes once the system is established: fail the build.

That last part matters. If you silently fall back forever, then a later filename rename silently changes the URL, which defeats the point of having `publicId`.

So the practical rule should be:

1. Backfill `publicId` onto all notes that will be published.
2. Generate URLs only from `publicId`.
3. Treat missing `publicId` on a publishable note as an error.
4. If you intentionally need to change a URL later, add aliases/redirects explicitly.

If you want, I’d add one more field from the start:

```yaml
publicAliases:
  - dev.old-guidance
```

That gives you a clean story for future redirects instead of pretending URLs never change.

# User_2026-04-06_1311_44

Update the task note.

How do we specify that "docs." maps to "/user-guide" -- is it that docs.md has a publicId of "user-guide" and sub-pages are calculated based on that?

root.md will effectively be the homepage.

BTW, probably docs.benefits is better just as a top-level "benefits"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1311_57

I’m refining the website task note now with the URL/identity contract so we stop hand-waving around filenames versus public paths. I’m going to lock three points into it: `root.md` as homepage, `publicId` as the stable published identity for in-scope notes, and the section-root mapping rules including `docs.* -> /user-guide/`.

I’ve got the contract shape. I’m updating the task note to make the URL mapping explicit instead of implicit: `root.md` as `/`, in-scope notes get `publicId`, section roots like `docs -> user-guide` are backfilled into those `publicId`s rather than guessed at build time, and `docs.benefits` is captured as a likely source-note cleanup before we freeze URLs.

The task note now has an explicit URL contract instead of an implied one. I’m doing a quick pass over the edited sections to make sure the rule is clear: `docs -> user-guide` is a backfill rule for each in-scope note’s `publicId`, not a magical runtime inheritance trick from the filename.

Updated [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md).

The note now locks this shape:

- `root.md` is the homepage source, so it maps to `/`.
- `docs -> /user-guide/` is handled as a `publicId` backfill rule, not as a permanent runtime guess from filenames.
- `docs.md` would get `publicId: user-guide`.
- `docs.compatibility.md` would get `publicId: user-guide.compatibility`.
- Missing `publicId` is allowed only during the bootstrap/backfill step; after that it becomes a build error for any in-scope published note.

I also captured `docs.benefits -> benefits` as a likely taxonomy cleanup before URL freeze, rather than baking the current note placement into the public contract. No tests were run since this was a task-note update only.

# User_2026-04-06_1320_03

I moved docs.benefits -> features

The other Open Issue: unpublished note references can link to source-files, e.g. https://github.com/spectacular-voyage/kato/blob/main/dev-docs/notes/conv.2026.2026-02-24-status.md

GitHub has a nice markdown renderer, can we re-use that? It automatically generates expandable thinking blocks from <summary> tags. Maybe we should re-introduce those!

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1320_15

I’m checking two things before I lock this in: the note move you just made, and the least-bad way to use GitHub’s Markdown presentation without turning the site build into a network-dependent or brittle pipeline. Then I’ll update the task note with a concrete decision instead of leaving it as an open issue.

You’ve answered the taxonomy question and mostly answered the unpublished-link question too. I’m updating the task note to remove the stale `docs.benefits` assumption, record `features` as a top-level page, and lock the unpublished-note behavior to GitHub source links rather than leaving it open.

The right split here is: use GitHub as the fallback reader for unpublished notes, but do not make GitHub’s renderer part of the site build pipeline. I’m updating the task note to capture that distinction, plus the `features` move and the decision to preserve/render raw `<details>/<summary>` blocks locally so we can bring expandable thinking sections back without depending on GitHub’s HTML.

Updated [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md).

It now records that:
- `features.md` is a top-level published page.
- unpublished note targets fall back to GitHub blob URLs under `documentation/notes/`
- the site build renders Markdown locally, not through GitHub’s API
- raw HTML blocks, including `<details>` / `<summary>`, are preserved in generated pages
- the `docs.benefits -> features` retaxonomization is already done

On the renderer question: yes to reusing GitHub as the fallback reader for unpublished notes, no to making GitHub’s renderer part of the build. GitHub does expose a Markdown render API, but using it would make the build network-dependent and tie output shape to GitHub’s rendering behavior rather than our own product contract. GitHub’s docs also explicitly support collapsed sections via `<details>` / `<summary>`, so the right move is to support those locally in our renderer and styling rather than outsourcing the whole page render to GitHub. If we want GitHub-like styling for a first pass, [`github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) is the least-coupled option. Sources: [GitHub Markdown API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown/markdown), [GitHub collapsed sections docs](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections), [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

One correction to the example URL: after the vault rename, the source-file fallback should point at `documentation/notes/...`, not `dev-docs/notes/...`.

No tests were run since this was a task-note update only.

# User_2026-04-06_1322_30

But Github's markdown renderer must be at least partially open-source.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1322_38

Partially, yes. Not enough to treat it as a stable build dependency.

The useful pieces are open:
- GitHub documents GFM behavior and has open material around it.
- GitHub’s parser stack exists in public form around `cmark-gfm`.
- Some presentation pieces are open, like [`github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), and GitHub’s own docs describe supported constructs like `<details>` / `<summary>`.

But “the exact renderer GitHub.com uses for repository file pages” is not a cleanly packaged, versioned, fully open source site-rendering component you can just vendor and trust as your product contract. The page rendering on github.com includes private integration behavior, sanitization choices, routing context, asset pipeline details, and presentation conventions that are not something I’d want Kato depending on.

So the pushback is:
- Reusing GitHub’s public repo-file pages as fallback destinations: good.
- Reusing open-source pieces of the GitHub Markdown ecosystem locally: good.
- Basing Kato’s site build on “whatever GitHub currently renders”: bad.

If you want the closest practical path, I’d aim for:
- local Markdown rendering with a GFM-capable parser
- preserve raw `<details>` / `<summary>`
- optional GitHub-like CSS for first-pass presentation
- GitHub blob links only for unpublished-note fallback

That gets most of the value without handing control of your build output to GitHub.

# User_2026-04-06_1334_57

I've done some research into parsers, see /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.conv.2025-11-29-rdf-storage-options.md

I would add "markdown-it-wikilinks" to that note's recommended stack of:

    markdown-it-gfm

    markdown-it-anchor

    markdown-it-table-of-contents

    highlight.js or shiki (via plugin) for code blocks

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1335_10

I’m reading that parser-research note now so I can anchor the website plan to the actual stack you investigated instead of improvising around `markdown-it` from memory. Then I’ll decide whether this should update the task note as a concrete implementation decision or stay as background context.

The path you pointed me to doesn’t actually contain parser research; it’s an RDF fixture/storage discussion. I’m checking whether you meant a different `sflo` note, and I’m also sanity-checking the proposed `markdown-it` stack against what this site task now needs so I can fold the right recommendation back into the plan.

The parser recommendation is in that note after all, just much later than the beginning. I’m looking at the exact section now so I can respond to your proposed `markdown-it-wikilinks` addition in the right level of detail rather than giving a generic “sure, sounds good.”

I’m going to encode a more precise renderer decision into the task note now. The main adjustment is that I don’t want us to accidentally commit to `markdown-it-wikilinks` as if it solves Dendron semantics by itself; it’s closer to a possible implementation aid than the actual URL-resolution contract.

That note does contain the parser recommendation, just much later in the file than the opening section you pointed me at.

I updated [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md) to capture the renderer direction:

- base renderer: `markdown-it`
- heading anchors, TOC, and code highlighting supported
- raw `<details>` / `<summary>` preserved
- Dendron wikilinks handled by Kato-owned logic on top of the renderer

I did not lock `markdown-it-wikilinks` as the core solution. That’s the important pushback: it may be useful as reference code or a parsing aid, but Kato still needs its own link-resolution layer because the hard part is not recognizing `[[note]]`; it’s resolving that against the note index, `publicId`, and unpublished-target fallback rules. No tests were run since this was a task-note update only.

# User_2026-04-06_1528_44

I renamed docs.compatibility to just compatibility, and renamed docs to user-guide. 

Right now, the README.md is basically the user guide. I wish there were a way to not repeat ourselves, but I guess it's okay for now.

Are we ready to start on the task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1529_06

Yes. The contract is tight enough now to start implementation. I’m first syncing the task note to your latest note renames (`user-guide`, `compatibility`, `features`) and then I’ll scaffold the generator as thin scripts over reusable modules so we don’t paint ourselves into a one-off corner.

The taxonomy changed enough that the task note needs one more cleanup before code lands. I’m making `publicId` the actual source of published hierarchy, folding `user-guide` and `compatibility` into the contract, and then I’ll start the generator against that contract instead of the older `docs.*` assumption.

The contract is consistent again: `publicId` drives published hierarchy, `user-guide` is the landing page, and `compatibility` is now an explicit remap into that section. I’m locking a build plan and then moving into code: note discovery/classification first, then renderer/linking, then HTML output into `docs/`.

# User_2026-04-06_1533_07

I'm ambivalent about publicId. Why not just use Dendron's id? Once you set it, it doesn't change, and we know it won't conflict at least within a vault because filenames can't overlap.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1533_44

You can. The real question is not uniqueness; it’s whether you want Dendron `id` to be the public URL contract.

Your “filenames can’t overlap” point is weaker than it sounds. The harder problems are:

- readable URLs
- explicit hierarchy/mounts like `development.*` and `user-guide.*`
- stability when filenames move

Current random Dendron ids fail the readability test. But if we deliberately rewrite the in-scope note ids to stable, human-readable route keys, then `publicId` becomes redundant.

Example:

- `user-guide.md` -> `id: user-guide`
- `compatibility.md` -> `id: user-guide.compatibility`
- `dev.general-guidance.md` -> `id: development.general-guidance`
- `features.md` -> `id: features`

Then URLs come from `id`, filenames stay free to change, and we don’t need a second field.

So my recommendation has shifted a bit:

- If you want to preserve the current random ids, keep `publicId`.
- If you’re willing to curate ids for published notes, drop `publicId` and use `id` as the canonical published path key.

Given your current direction, I think the second option is cleaner. It removes a whole field and makes the contract simpler.

The only real downside is that `id` stops being “just Dendron internals” and becomes product-facing. I don’t think that’s a problem here.

If you want, I can switch the task note from `publicId` to “published notes use curated Dendron `id` values as their URL identity,” and then we can implement against that simpler contract.

# User_2026-04-06_1542_36

Yes, switch

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1542_45

I’m replacing the `publicId` contract with curated Dendron `id` values now so the site identity stays stable without inventing a second field. I’m first finding every place in the task note that still treats `publicId` as canonical, then I’ll rewrite the contract, decisions, tests, and checklist around `id` instead.

I’ve got the old `publicId` assumptions isolated. I’m rewriting them now into a simpler contract: curated Dendron `id` values for published notes become the stable URL identity, and the generator validates those ids instead of looking for a second field.

The contract rewrite is in. I’m doing one verification pass for stale `publicId` language so we don’t carry a split-brain spec into implementation.

Switched the task note to use curated Dendron `id` values instead of `publicId` in [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md).

The contract now says:
- published URLs come from curated note `id`
- in-scope published notes need their random legacy ids rewritten once
- the generator validates curated ids and uses them for internal links and URL generation

Yes, this is ready enough to start implementation. The next real prerequisite is just the id migration for the in-scope notes, then the generator can build against that contract. No tests were run since this was a task-note update only.

new chat or this one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1544_53

New chat.

The task note is now the contract anchor, and the implementation work is about to become code-heavy and multi-step. A fresh thread will keep the build/fixes/reviews cleaner and make it easier to capture progress back into [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md) without dragging along all the naming and URL-shape exploration.

Use the new chat to start with that task note plus the current note set:
- [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md)
- [user-guide.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/user-guide.md)
- [compatibility.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/compatibility.md)
- [features.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/features.md)
- [root.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/root.md)

If you want, I can give you a one-paragraph kickoff prompt for that new chat.

Continue implementation of the Kato static documentation site from [task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06-kato-website.md). The source vault is `documentation/notes`, generated output must go into `docs/`, and the published URL contract is based on curated Dendron `id` values for in-scope notes, not filenames or a separate `publicId`. Start by updating the in-scope published notes to their curated ids, then implement a Deno-first site generator with reusable modules plus thin script entrypoints, using a `markdown-it`-based renderer, Kato-owned Dendron wikilink resolution, GitHub blob fallbacks for unpublished note links, and support for raw `<details>/<summary>` blocks. Relevant notes to inspect first: [root.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/root.md), [user-guide.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/user-guide.md), [compatibility.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/compatibility.md), [features.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/features.md), plus the existing Dendron helpers in the repo.

# User_2026-04-06_1546_19

Should we do it as a separate application from the start. I'm definitely going to want to use this in multiple places.

How do we specify what notes are "in" vs "out" of the site build?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1546_50

Yes, but with one constraint: separate application from the start, not separate ecosystem from the start.

I would do this as:
- a dedicated app/module in this monorepo
- config-driven from day one
- thin Kato-specific config on top of generic note-site logic

I would not immediately split it into its own repo or try to make it fully universal before the first working build. The clean middle ground is:

- generic app: note discovery, markdown rendering, wikilink resolution, URL building, HTML generation
- repo config: source dir, output dir, section rules, note inclusion rules, GitHub fallback URL template, assets, theme bits

That gives you reuse without forcing premature abstraction.

For “what notes are in vs out”, I would use explicit config with default-deny behavior. That is much safer than “publish everything except a few patterns”.

A good shape is:

```yaml
sourceNotesDir: documentation/notes
outputDir: docs
homepageNote: root

sections:
  - id: development
    title: Development
    landingNote: dev
    include:
      - "dev.*"

  - id: user-guide
    title: User Guide
    landingNote: user-guide
    include:
      - "compatibility"

  - id: release-notes
    title: Release Notes
    include:
      - "release-notes.*"

  - id: contributors
    title: Contributors
    include:
      - "contributor.*"

pages:
  - note: features
  - note: roadmap
  - note: product-ideas

exclude:
  - "conv.*"
  - "task.*"
  - "completed.*"
  - "cancelled.*"
  - "template.*"
```

The important rule is:
- A note is “in” only if it is explicitly named by `homepageNote`, `sections[*].landingNote`, `sections[*].include`, or `pages`.
- Everything else is out unless later included.

I’d also allow a small frontmatter override layer for exceptions, like:
- `site.exclude: true`
- `site.section: user-guide`
- `site.path: /custom-path/`

But config should be the main inclusion mechanism, not frontmatter. Frontmatter-only control gets messy fast in mixed-purpose vaults.

So my recommendation is:
- yes, make it a separate app now
- no, don’t make it a separate repo yet
- make inclusion explicit and default-deny
- keep Kato as the first config/profile, not the whole architecture

If you want, I can turn that into a concrete config schema and adjust the task note accordingly.

# User_2026-04-06_1548_35

yes please

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1548_43

I’m updating the website task note to lock two architectural choices: this starts as a separate app inside the monorepo, and site inclusion is config-driven with default-deny semantics. I’m pulling the current task text first so I can patch the contract, example config, and checklist coherently.

I’m folding the separate-app and default-deny inclusion model into the task note now. I’m also sanity-checking the current note set so the example config reflects the names you’ve actually settled on instead of the older `docs.*` shape.

# User_2026-04-06_1549_15

why not do a separate repo?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1549_28

You can do a separate repo. I’m pushing against it now because the contract is still moving.

What is still unsettled enough to make a separate repo expensive:
- inclusion/config model
- curated `id` migration rules
- URL contract details
- Dendron wikilink behavior
- unpublished-note fallback behavior
- the boundary between generic engine and Kato-specific profile

If you put it in a separate repo today, you pay for all of this immediately:
- versioning and release process
- package/app distribution shape
- cross-repo CI and local iteration friction
- API/config stability pressure before we’ve proven the design
- duplicate issue/task/docs context across repos

A separate app in this monorepo gets most of the upside without that cost:
- clear module boundary
- reusable config-driven architecture
- easy extraction later
- fast iteration against the first real consumer

So my recommendation is:

- `apps/note-site` in this repo now
- design it as if it could be extracted
- actually extract it when one of these becomes true:
  - a second repo needs it
  - the config schema stops moving
  - the renderer/linking behavior feels stable enough to version

That is the pragmatic threshold. Before then, a separate repo is mostly ceremony and friction.

If you want maximum future portability, we can structure it now as:
- `apps/note-site/` for CLI/app entrypoints
- `shared/src/note_site/` or `lib/note-site/` for the reusable core

Then extraction is mechanical instead of architectural.

# User_2026-04-06_1557_42

I wanna go with a new repo from the start. We'll just clone it in as a gitignored dependency, then we don't have to fuss over extraction.

For a name, what do you think of "dendrosite"? Any other ideas?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1558_10

That’s workable. If you do a new repo from the start, I’d just make the tradeoff explicit:

- good: clean boundary, no extraction later, reusable from day one
- bad: bootstrap friction, cross-repo iteration, and CI/setup complexity

The main thing I’d push on is not the separate repo, but the “gitignored dependency” part. Hidden local clones get messy fast. Better options:

- a documented sibling checkout path
- a `dependencies/...` checkout with a bootstrap script
- or a submodule if you want stronger reproducibility

On the name: `dendrosite` is decent. It’s short, memorable, and honestly says “Dendron -> site.”

Its weakness is that it sounds a bit like a website about Dendron, not necessarily a generator.

My ranking would be:

1. `dendrosite`
2. `dendron-publish`
3. `dendron-ssg`
4. `dendron-site-generator`
5. `vaultsite`

How I’d choose:
- `dendrosite`: best product-ish name
- `dendron-publish`: best descriptive name
- `dendron-ssg`: best blunt engineering name
- `vaultsite`: only if you expect to broaden beyond Dendron later

If you want my actual recommendation, I’d pick `dendrosite` for the repo name and keep the package/CLI names more explicit, like:

- repo: `dendrosite`
- CLI: `dendrosite`
- package/module: `@dendrosite/core` or `dendrosite-core`

If you want, I can update the task note to assume “external repo from the start” and sketch the integration shape for Kato.

# User_2026-04-06_1615_03

I've decided to head in a different direction. We will use weave for the SSG. But I just need to get a kato single-page website up fast. You can generate it directly into /docs, content comes primarily from README but feel free to include other sources and to make up some marketing copy. Generate [[task.2026.2026-04-06_1613-simple-kato-site]] for me.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1615_16

I’m switching to the simpler one-page site direction and will draft the new task note around that reduced scope. First I’m pulling the current task stub, the cancelled broader site note, the README, and the repo guidance so the task contract matches what you’ve actually decided.

I’ve got the simple-site direction. Before I write the task note, I’m checking the brand asset filenames and a couple of likely content sources so the contract names the actual files we’ll pull from instead of hand-waving.

I’ve got enough context. I’m replacing the stub with a real task note that reflects the fast path: one committed landing page in `docs/`, README-first content, existing brand assets, and an explicit deferment of the reusable SSG/Weave architecture so this task doesn’t get hijacked by platform work.

The stub file is still minimal, so I’m replacing it wholesale instead of trying to patch section-by-section. That will be cleaner and less error-prone than surgical edits against empty headings.

The task note is in place. I’m just verifying the resulting file content once, because the whole-file replacement showed up as delete/add in the patch tool and I want to make sure the note on disk is exactly what we intended.

It now captures the reduced scope clearly:
- single-page site only
- output directly into `docs/`
- `README.md` as primary source
- optional support from `features.md`, `compatibility.md`, and `user-guide.md`
- reuse existing Kato brand assets
- explicitly defer the reusable Weave/SSG architecture

# User_2026-04-06_1617_24

The site can pull design direction from https://spectacular.voyage/. I already mentioned the assets that exist in this repo.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1617_30

I’m pulling the current `spectacular.voyage` site now so I can translate that visual direction into the task note instead of relying on memory. Then I’ll update the simple-site task to name the reference site and the repo-local assets together as the design inputs.

I’ve got the current public site context. It already uses the Kato “Own your AI conversations” framing, a sparse product-landing layout, and the broader Spectacular Voyage visual language, so I’m adding that as an explicit design reference in the task note rather than leaving design direction implicit.

Updated [task.2026.2026-04-06_1613-simple-kato-site.md](../../../../spectacular-voyage/kato/documentation/notes/task.2026.2026-04-06_1613-simple-kato-site.md) to make the design inputs explicit:

- `README.md` remains the primary factual source
- repo-local Kato assets remain the primary brand assets
- `https://spectacular.voyage/` is now recorded as the visual/design-direction reference for the first pass

I also captured a few concrete cues from the current site: strong hero framing, sparse section rhythm, generous whitespace, and overall Spectacular Voyage brand continuity.

# User_2026-04-06_1755_14

I think we should include a screenshot or two. Can I just paste them here and you can put them in the right place?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1755_24

Yes.

Paste or attach the screenshots here, and I can:
- place them in a sensible repo location
- wire them into the page layout
- size/crop/style them appropriately for the site

If you already know the intended role for each image, tell me that too, for example:
- hero product shot
- feature/demo screenshot
- workflow screenshot
- compatibility/supporting image

If not, I’ll infer placement from the content.
