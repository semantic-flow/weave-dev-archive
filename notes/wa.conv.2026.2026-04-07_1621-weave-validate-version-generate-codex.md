weave validate-version-generate

Implement [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]] first. Use [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]] as the targeting contract, but do not put payload naming fields into generic TargetSpec.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1436_20

I’m reading the repository guidance and the two task notes first, then I’ll inspect the current `validate-version-generate` implementation and wire it to the targeting contract without polluting generic `TargetSpec`.

I have the relevant notes located. Next I’m reading the product vision, general guidance, and both task notes to extract the exact contract and constraints before touching code.

The notes confirm the shape: shared resource-root `TargetSpec`, version-only naming on `VersionTargetSpec`, and `weave` should become orchestration rather than a special parallel contract. I’m locating the current core/runtime/CLI seams now so I can change the minimal set of types and flows coherently.

I’ve confirmed the current code is still pre-targeting: `WeaveRequest` is just `designatorPaths`, runtime prefilters candidates by exact path, and there are no standalone `validate` / `version` / `generate` seams yet. I’m mapping the smallest refactor that introduces those contracts without breaking the existing woven slices or over-designing the CLI.

I have the runtime helpers mapped now. The cleanest path is a small shared targeting module plus extracted local `validate`, `version`, and `generate` seams in `runtime/weave`, with `executeWeave` delegating to them. That keeps the CLI stable for now and matches the task note’s “internal seams before ergonomics” requirement.

I’m checking the settled fixtures next, because `generate` has to reproduce the existing HTML outputs from workspace state, and the hard part is the page set around `alice`/`bob` after extraction. I need to see exactly which pages differ across the carried slices before I lock the generation rules.

# User_2026-04-07_1443_29

actual content of the HTML outputs doesn't matter much right now. It definitely doesn't have to be consistent with the mesh-alice-bio ladder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1444_56

The HTML constraint changes the implementation boundary in a useful way: I can keep `generate` strictly settled-state-based without trying to preserve the exact `mesh-alice-bio` page prose. I’m going to make page generation path-driven and relax the brittle HTML byte-for-byte tests so the decomposition is tested on behavior instead of fixture text.

I’m editing the core contract now: `WeaveRequest` is moving off `designatorPaths` and onto target specs, with separate `Validate` / `Generate` / `Version` request types so version-only naming fields are enforced at the boundary instead of leaking into generic targeting.

I found one real trap in the current split: `planWeave(...)` still smuggles some HTML writes inside `createdFiles` / `updatedFiles` for the extracted slice. I’m fixing that at the version seam so `version` owns only RDF mutations and `generate` owns all HTML, even for Bob’s carried case.

The runtime split is in place now. I’m adding tests for the shared targeting resolver next, then I’ll update the weave tests to the new `targets` contract and relax the HTML assertions so they stop pinning the old page prose.

I’m relaxing the integration tests where they were pinning HTML bytes. The important checks here are now RDF/version correctness, page existence, and the fact that `generate` runs from settled state without mutating RDF artifacts.

I’m adding direct integration coverage for the new seams now: request-field boundary checks, `generate` staying HTML-only, and `generate` refusing to invent future state from pre-version workspace data.

The type and runtime wiring is in. I’m running `deno check` first to catch the contract fallout before I touch anything else, then I’ll fix the compile errors in one pass and run the tests.

The code type-checks cleanly. I’m running the test suite now; the likely failures at this point are behavioral mismatches where the new settled-state `generate` changes page counts or old tests were still coupled to the pre-split path accounting.

The remaining failures are exactly where expected: one mistaken targeting expectation on my side, a few tests still assuming old path accounting, and one test that was checking the old “page already exists” failure mode that no longer applies once HTML is owned by `generate`. I’m correcting those to match the new seam boundaries.

The focused failures are cleared. I’m rerunning the full suite now, then I’ll do lint and package the changes with a concrete commit message.

The tests are green. I’m running formatting and lint now so the new modules and relaxed tests land in a clean state, then I’ll summarize exactly what changed and give you a commit message that matches the repo guidance.

Implemented the split in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts): `executeWeave()` now composes standalone `executeValidate()`, `executeVersion()`, and `executeGenerate()`. Shared resource targeting lives in [src/core/targeting.ts](../../src/core/targeting.ts), and [src/core/weave/weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) now uses target-scoped requests instead of `designatorPaths`. `TargetSpec` only carries `designatorPath` and `recursive`; `historySegment` and `stateSegment` are confined to `VersionTargetSpec`.

`generate` is now settled-state-only and HTML-oriented, without trying to stay byte-identical to the `mesh-alice-bio` ladder. I updated the weave tests accordingly in [tests/integration/weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts) and [tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts), and added seam-focused coverage in [src/core/targeting_test.ts](../../src/core/targeting_test.ts) and [tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts](../../tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts).

One important limitation remains: `historySegment` / `stateSegment` are now accepted only on version/weave requests and rejected on validate/generate, but the current slice planners still do not apply those fields to RDF path generation yet.

Validation run: `deno task check`, `deno task fmt`, `deno task lint`, `deno task test`.

Suggested commit message:
```text
feat(weave): split local weave into validate/version/generate seams

- add shared resource-target contracts and keep version-only naming fields out of generic targets
- implement standalone runtime validate, version, and settled-state generate operations
- re-express executeWeave as orchestration over those seams
- add targeting and seam-focused integration coverage
- relax weave HTML assertions so tests validate behavior rather than fixture prose
```

# User_2026-04-07_1504_31

how do I clean up unused local git branches

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1504_49

In a repo, the safe sequence is:

1. `git fetch --prune`
2. `git checkout main`  
3. `git branch --merged`
4. `git branch -d <branch>`

Use `-d` for branches already fully merged. Use `-D` only if you want to delete an unmerged local branch.

For bulk cleanup of merged local branches:

```bash
git fetch --prune
git checkout main
git branch --merged | grep -vE '^\*|main$|master$|develop$' | xargs -r git branch -d
```

A few important distinctions:

- `git branch -d foo` deletes a local branch.
- `git branch -D foo` force-deletes a local branch.
- `git remote prune origin` only removes stale remote-tracking refs like `origin/foo`; it does not delete your local branches.

If you want, I can inspect this repo and give you the exact local branches that are safe to delete.

# User_2026-04-07_1506_01

ok

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1506_14

I’m checking the repo’s default branch and merged local branches now. I’ll use Git’s merged-to-default-branch view so the delete candidates are the conservative ones.

I’ve got the local branch table and refreshed remotes. One command is still resolving the remote’s default branch; then I’ll tell you which branches are merged and which are merely stale.

`origin`’s default branch is `main`, and after `git fetch --prune` this repo has no local branches that are unmerged into `main`.

Safe to delete with `git branch -d`:

- `08-alice-bio-referenced`
- `09`
- `10-alice-bio-updated`
- `11-alice-bio-v2-woven`
- `12-bob-extracted`
- `integrate-alice-bio`
- `rdf-parsing`
- `validate-version-generate`
- `weave-alic-bio-integrated-woven`

You can delete them in one shot:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d 08-alice-bio-referenced 09 10-alice-bio-updated 11-alice-bio-v2-woven 12-bob-extracted integrate-alice-bio rdf-parsing validate-version-generate weave-alic-bio-integrated-woven
```

Or generically:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch --merged main | grep -vE '^\*|main$' | xargs -r git branch -d
```

Why this is safe here: `git branch --no-merged main` returned nothing.

# User_2026-04-07_1512_11

I accidentally commited the validate-version-generate changes to main. So I can't do a PR for coderabbit to review. How can I get a coderabbit review.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1513_09

CodeRabbit is PR-centric, so if the change is already on `main`, the cleanest move is to create a synthetic PR just for review.

**Fastest**
If you only want review and do not want to rewrite or revert `main`:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Find:
- the commit before your accidental change: `<base>`
- the last commit you want reviewed: `<head>`

Then:

```bash
git branch coderabbit-base <base>
git branch coderabbit-review <head>
git push origin coderabbit-base coderabbit-review
```

Open a PR:
- base: `coderabbit-base`
- compare: `coderabbit-review`

That PR will contain exactly your change set, and CodeRabbit can review it. Afterward, close the PR and delete the temp branches.

**Proper workflow**
If you want the repo history back into normal PR shape:

1. Create a feature branch at the accidental commit(s).
2. Revert those commits on `main`.
3. Open a PR from the feature branch back into `main`.

Example for one accidental commit:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c validate-version-generate-review
git push -u origin validate-version-generate-review

git switch main
git revert <bad-commit>
git push origin main
```

Then open PR:
- base: `main`
- compare: `validate-version-generate-review`

That PR effectively reapplies the same change, so CodeRabbit reviews it normally.

**If you have not pushed `main` yet**
That is simpler:

```bash
git switch -c validate-version-generate-review
git push -u origin validate-version-generate-review
git switch main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Then open the PR from `validate-version-generate-review` to `main`.

If you want, I can tell you the exact commands for your current repo state once you tell me whether the accidental commit is already pushed to `origin/main`.

# User_2026-04-07_1514_33

it is already pushed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1514_44

I’m checking the recent `main` history so I can give you the least disruptive branch/PR path for this exact repo state, without telling you to rewrite `main`.

Since the accidental change is already on `origin/main`, the least disruptive way is a review-only synthetic PR.

In this repo, the exact range is:

- base commit: `1361d16` (`docs: grooming`)
- change to review: `0a7f101` (`feat(weave): split local weave into validate/version/generate seams`)

Run:

```bash
git branch cr/validate-version-generate-base 1361d16
git branch cr/validate-version-generate-review 0a7f101
git push origin cr/validate-version-generate-base cr/validate-version-generate-review
```

Then open a PR with:

- base: `cr/validate-version-generate-base`
- compare/head: `cr/validate-version-generate-review`

That PR will show exactly the diff from `1361d16..0a7f101`, so CodeRabbit can review it even though the code is already on `main`.

Important points:

- Do not merge that PR.
- Mark it clearly as review-only in the title/body.
- After CodeRabbit finishes, close the PR and delete the temp branches.

If you use `gh`, this is the full version:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base cr/validate-version-generate-base \
  --head cr/validate-version-generate-review \
  --title "Review-only: validate/version/generate split" \
  --body "Review-only PR for CodeRabbit. These changes are already on main; this PR exists only to get automated review on commit 0a7f101."
```

If you want, I can also give you the cleanup commands for deleting those temp branches after the review.

# User_2026-04-07_1523_17

Coderabbit wouldn't review that way, let's try the "proper workflow". What's the "bad commit"?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1523_28

The “bad commit” is:

```bash
0a7f101
```

That is the accidental commit currently on `main` / `origin/main`:

```text
0a7f101 feat(weave): split local weave into validate/version/generate seams
```

The last good commit before it is:

```bash
1361d16
```

So the proper workflow is:

```bash
git switch main
git switch -c validate-version-generate-review 0a7f101
git push -u origin validate-version-generate-review

git switch main
git revert 0a7f101
git push origin main
```

Then open a normal PR:

- base: `main`
- head: `validate-version-generate-review`

That PR will reintroduce exactly the reverted change, and CodeRabbit should review it normally.

If you want, I can also give you the exact `gh pr create` command for this repo.

# User_2026-04-07_1525_56

I used "git push -u origin validate-version-generate" and the github message is "main is up to date with all commits from validate-version-generate."

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1526_16

I’m checking the branch tips now so I can tell you the exact next step from the repo’s current state, not from stale history.

That GitHub message is expected with your current history.

`main` is now at:

```bash
8969cc6 Revert "feat(weave): split local weave into validate/version/generate seams"
```

and `validate-version-generate` is still at:

```bash
0a7f101 feat(weave): split local weave into validate/version/generate seams
```

The problem is that `0a7f101` is still in `main`'s history. It was reverted, not removed. GitHub PRs compare commit ancestry, not “net diff after revert”, so a branch pointing at `0a7f101` looks already contained by `main`.

What you need now is a new branch based on current `main` that re-applies the change as a new commit.

Use this:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c validate-version-generate-rereview
git revert 8969cc6
git push -u origin validate-version-generate-rereview
```

Then open the PR:

- base: `main`
- head: `validate-version-generate-rereview`

That PR should be reviewable by CodeRabbit, because it contains a new commit on top of current `main`.

If you prefer, `git cherry-pick 0a7f101` from a new branch off `main` would also work, but `git revert 8969cc6` is cleaner in this situation.

# User_2026-04-07_1741_39

What do you think of coderabbits comments in [wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md](wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md) ? Add checkboxes for each, and mark [c] for cancelled for those not worth doing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1741_52

I’m reading the CodeRabbit review note first, then I’ll classify each comment into actionable vs not-worth-doing and patch the note with `[ ]` / `[c]` checkboxes accordingly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1741_59

I’ve got the review note. I’m checking the current code at the cited spots now so I can classify each comment on substance rather than just echoing CodeRabbit.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1742_18

I’ve classified them. I’m patching the review note now with explicit `[ ]` / `[c]` dispositions and short reasons so the note becomes an actionable triage list rather than a raw dump.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1742_40

I triaged the CodeRabbit comments in [wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md](wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md) and added checkboxes.

My take:

- `[c]` the `WeaveRuntimeError` test comment is stale. The current orchestration intentionally turns validate-time failures into `WeaveInputError` before `executeWeave(...)` returns.
- `[c]` the `ValidateFinding.severity` widening is speculative. The current first pass only emits errors, and the narrow type is useful.
- `[c]` the redundant guard in `filterWeaveableKnops(...)` is true but low-value. It’s harmless defensive code.
- `[ ]` the re-normalization in `prepareVersionExecution(...)` is the only comment I’d keep as worthwhile cleanup.

I didn’t change code, just the review note.

# User_2026-04-07_1748_27

ok, do it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1748_39

I’m implementing the one CodeRabbit comment worth keeping: remove the duplicate target normalization in `prepareVersionExecution(...)`, then I’ll rerun the narrow tests and lint and mark the review note done.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1748_50

I’m patching the runtime seam now: `prepareVersionExecution(...)` will take normalized targets directly, and I’ll update the review note to `[x]` once the code and checks pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1749_07

The code change is in. I’m running typecheck, the seam-focused integration tests, and lint now; if anything broke it will be around the normalized-target conversions.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1749_19

Implemented the worthwhile CodeRabbit cleanup in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts): `prepareVersionExecution(...)` now accepts already-normalized targets, so the duplicate `normalizeVersionRequest(...)` pass is gone. `executeValidate(...)` converts generic normalized targets once, and `executeVersion(...)` passes normalized version targets through directly.

I also marked that review item `[x]` in [wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md](wd.review.2026-04-07-validate-version-generate-coderabbit.md).

Validation run:
- `deno task check`
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env tests/integration/validate_version_generate_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`

# User_2026-04-07_1750_45

we're still on the validate-version-generate-rereview -- do I need to do anything special to mege to main?

# User_2026-04-07_1753_56

help me clean up those temporary branches

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_12

I’m checking the current branch graph and merged status first so I can tell the temporary review branches apart from anything you may still want to keep, then I’ll clean up the obvious ones.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_17

I found the merged temporary branches. I’m leaving your current `targeting` branch alone and deleting only the old review branches: the local `cr/*` branches plus the old `validate-version-generate*` branches, and the matching remote temp branches.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_22

The local cleanup is done. I’m removing the matching remote temp branches next, then I’ll show you what remains.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_30

Two of the remote temp refs were already gone, so Git aborted that delete batch early. I’m checking the remaining remote refs and deleting only what still exists.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_41

The only remote temp branch left was `origin/validate-version-generate`. I’ve sent that delete now; then I’ll do one last prune/list so you have the final state.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1754_53

Cleaned up the temporary review branches.

What remains locally:
- `main`
- `targeting`

What remains remotely:
- `origin/main`

Current branch is still `targeting`, and the only uncommitted change is:
- [wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1621-weave-validate-version-generate-codex.md](wd.conv.2026.2026-04-07_1621-weave-validate-version-generate-codex.md)

Deleted local branches:
- `cr/validate-version-generate-base`
- `cr/validate-version-generate-review`
- `validate-version-generate`
- `validate-version-generate-review`

Deleted remote branch:
- `origin/validate-version-generate`

The old `cr/*` remote refs were already gone and disappeared after `git fetch --prune`.
