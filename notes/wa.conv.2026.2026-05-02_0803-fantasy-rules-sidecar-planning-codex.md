fantasy rules sidecar planning

Please review [[wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar]] and other relevant guidance. 

- I think we need to update [[sf.api.examples]] and modify the task note to reference how we did things with mesh-alice-bio
- are we still going to use the branch-based ladder approach? 
- Is accord/conformance manifests really "Phase 6"? We did those earlier with alice-bio

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0030_36

I’ll read the repository guidance first, then inspect the task note, the framework examples, and the existing `mesh-alice-bio` references so the planning edits stay aligned with the project’s conventions.

The current task note already has the right sidecar shape, but it treats Accord as late acceptance and leaves the branch ladder question unresolved. I’m checking the Alice Bio fixture and framework conformance docs now, because those are the strongest precedent for the answer.

One important correction from the existing precedent: Alice Bio uses branches for human review, but the conformance unit is the transition manifest. I’m going to patch the task note in that direction and move Accord/conformance earlier, instead of treating it as a final cleanup phase.

I’m making two documentation edits now: one in the Weave task note to settle the ladder/conformance ordering, and one in the framework API examples note to name Fantasy Rules Sidecar as the next planned example family.

The edits are in place. I’m reviewing the resulting diffs now to make sure I didn’t accidentally turn planning guidance into a stronger implementation commitment than the current docs support.

I also noticed the fixture repository already exists locally with only an initial README, so I’m tightening the task wording from “create the repo” to “build it out” without marking anything complete.

Updated the planning docs.

Direct answers:

- Yes, keep the branch-based ladder, but treat branches as the inspectable fixture state, not the normative contract. The Accord manifest is the transition contract.
- No, Accord/conformance should not be Phase 6. I moved it into the early ladder/transition phases so manifests are authored as transitions settle.
- I updated [sf.api.examples.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.api.examples.md:51) with a new Fantasy Rules Sidecar example family and the Alice Bio-style `api/` + `conformance/` split.
- I updated [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md:40) to reference Alice Bio precedent, settle the ladder decision, and move Accord work into Phases 0-4 instead of Phase 6.

I also adjusted the task wording because `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` already exists locally with only an initial README, so the task now says to build it out rather than create it from scratch.

No tests or linter run; this was documentation-only.

Suggested commit message:

```text
docs: align fantasy sidecar planning with Alice Bio precedent

- document that Fantasy Rules Sidecar should keep a numbered branch ladder
- clarify that Accord manifests are transition contracts, not late acceptance cleanup
- move conformance work into the early fixture phases
- add the planned sidecar-fantasy-rules example family to sf.api.examples
- note the docs-rooted sidecar API and conformance pressure points
```

# User_2026-05-02_0034_23

The branches are useful for human review, but also for testing purposes, right? We can check out a branch and make sure that applying the changes and the weave produces something that matches the conformance.

I think we should reference https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf - creating the fantasy-rules-ontology is a decent-sized lift unto itself.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0034_32

I’ll verify the SRD source and license signal first, then patch the task note so the branch ladder is described as both a human-review surface and a test fixture surface.

The SRD PDF identifies itself as “System Reference Document 5.2.1” and says it is under CC-BY-4.0, with required attribution. I’m adding that as a source boundary, and I’m making the testing role of branches explicit rather than leaving it implied by Alice Bio.

The task note now treats `fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` as a real modeling slice, not a throwaway seed file. I’m doing a quick diff review so the added branch-test language is concrete but still planning-level.

Yes. I’d treat branch checkouts as acceptance/integration fixtures, not ordinary unit-test fixtures. The useful loop is: check out source branch, run the intended operation or `weave`, compare the resulting workspace to the destination branch, and evaluate the matching Accord manifest.

I updated [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md:41) to say that explicitly, including branch refs as test fixtures at lines 130, 147, 157, and 191.

I also added the SRD 5.2.1 PDF as the source-reference boundary for the ontology work and called out that `fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` is a real modeling slice, not incidental setup. I verified the PDF’s legal page identifies it as SRD 5.2.1 and says it is under CC-BY-4.0 with attribution requirements: https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf

No tests/linter run; this was documentation planning only.

# User_2026-05-02_0100_05

Any open issues we should address, or questions?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0100_24

Yes. I’d settle a few before building branches.

1. **First ladder shape**
   Recommended first ladder:
   - `00-blank-slate`
   - `01-source-only`
   - `02-sidecar-mesh-created`
   - `03-sidecar-mesh-created-woven`
   - `04-ontology-integrated`
   - `05-ontology-integrated-woven`
   - `06-shacl-integrated`
   - `07-shacl-integrated-woven`
   - then resource-page polish branches after the core sidecar path works

   I would avoid a separate “release” branch until we decide whether `v0.1.0` is just the first woven named state or a distinct operation beyond normal `weave`.

2. **Ontology source scope**
   This is the biggest real question. I’d split `fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` planning into its own task if we want more than a very small seed. Recommended first slice: `AbilityScore`, `Character`, `Alignment`, maybe six ability score individuals or controlled values. Defer classes/species/spells/equipment/combat.

3. **Hash vs slash terms**
   Recommendation: use hash IRIs first, e.g. `/ontology#AbilityScore`. Slash-term pages are a useful later extraction/page-generation task, but they will expand scope fast.

4. **SRD attribution**
   We should decide a concrete attribution pattern before authoring source. Recommended: put required CC-BY attribution in `NOTICE.md` or `ATTRIBUTION.md`, plus `dcterms:source`, `dcterms:license`, and a concise attribution note in the ontology metadata.

5. **Helper content path**
   Recommendation: choose `docs/_mesh/_content/`. It keeps helper content clearly mesh-owned and avoids top-level publication clutter.

Main question for you: should I update the task note with these recommendations as decisions, or keep them as open issues until we discuss the first ladder and ontology slice a little more?

# User_2026-05-02_0128_37

#1 , fine for now. We can add version-bumped ontology later.
#2, small seed is fine
#3, We'll want to support both hash and slash terms eventually, I personally prefer slash. See /home/djradon/hub/djradon/dendron-workspace/public-notes/vs.hash-vs-slash.md -- let's do slashes first.
#4 NOTICE.md. dcterms:license would be the license for the fantasy-rules ontology, 
#5 yes!

Update with these decisions.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0128_47

I’ll fold these into the task note as settled decisions, and I’ll skim the hash-vs-slash note first so the slash-term decision reflects your existing reasoning rather than just a preference line.

I’ve got the decisions. I’m patching the note now: initial ladder settled, slash terms first, `NOTICE.md` for SRD attribution, `docs/_mesh/_content/`, and a small seed ontology with version-bump work deferred.

# User_2026-05-02_0129_41

maybe _mesh/content is better, underscore means "semantic flow-reserved"

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0129_46

Good point. If `_mesh` already marks the reserved Semantic Flow surface, a second `_content` underscore is probably redundant. I’m changing the settled helper path to `docs/_mesh/content/`.

The path replacement is done. I’m checking the affected lines and one broader slice to make sure all references now agree.

Updated the task note to use `docs/_mesh/content/`.

That reasoning is right: `_mesh` already marks the Semantic Flow-reserved area, so `content/` under it is clear enough and less visually noisy than `_content/`. I changed the discussion, decision, and Phase 0 checklist references.

# User_2026-05-02_0140_20

OK, ready to start phase 0?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0140_34

Yes. I’ll start Phase 0 as a planning/artifact setup slice: tighten the task note around the settled decisions, create the first conformance README scaffold in the framework examples tree, and leave branch creation/source files for Phase 1.

The current task note already has most decisions recorded. I’m going to add the framework conformance README and do a narrow SRD check for the small seed concepts so Phase 0 can be marked based on actual source context, not just memory.

`pdftotext` is not installed, so I’m checking for another local PDF extraction path before falling back to a lighter source review.

I found the official D&D Beyond SRD landing page confirms SRD 5.2.1 and that the SRD is Creative Commons material. Local PDF text extraction is limited on this machine, so I’m keeping the SRD review item narrowly scoped instead of pretending we completed a full source pass.

The conformance README scaffold is in place. I’m now marking the Phase 0 planning items that are actually settled, while leaving the deeper SRD content review unchecked because we haven’t done a real source-modeling pass yet.

The task note now records the concrete slash-term path assumption and moves actual `NOTICE.md` creation into Phase 1, while keeping the Phase 0 attribution decision checked off. I’m reviewing the final diffs and statuses now.

Started Phase 0.

Updated [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md:80) to lock in root-level slash term IRIs like `terms/AbilityScore`, mark settled Phase 0 planning items complete, and move actual `NOTICE.md` creation into Phase 1.

Added the initial conformance scaffold at [README.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/README.md:1). It documents the first ladder, branch-ref testing loop, sidecar path conventions, and manifest conventions.

One Phase 0 item remains open: the real SRD source review for the small seed slice. I verified the official SRD source boundary, but `pdftotext` is not installed here, so I did not pretend to complete a full source-modeling pass. Sources checked: [SRD 5.2.1 PDF](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf), [D&D Beyond SRD page](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd).

# User_2026-05-02_0149_09

The SRD is available in markdown here: https://github.com/springbov/dndsrd5.2_markdown/blob/main/DND-SRD-5.2-CC.md

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0149_16

That helps. I’ll treat the GitHub Markdown as a convenience working copy for source review, while keeping the official SRD PDF as the legal/source boundary, then update the Phase 0 note accordingly.

The Markdown copy has the relevant sections in plain text, including “The Six Abilities,” “Character Creation,” “Ability Scores,” and “Alignment.” I’m using it to finish the small seed review and will document it as a convenience copy, not the license authority.

That is enough to complete the narrow SRD seed review: ability scores, alignment, and player-character/character creation are all present in the Markdown copy. I’m updating the task note and conformance README to name that repo as a convenience source.

Phase 0 is now fully checked off in the task note. I’m doing a final diff/status pass before I summarize exactly what changed and what Phase 1 should start with.

Good pointer. That lets Phase 0 close cleanly.

I updated [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md:15) to treat the Markdown transcription as a working convenience source, while keeping the official SRD/PDF attribution authoritative. I also marked the remaining Phase 0 SRD review item complete after checking the Markdown for the small seed scope: abilities/ability scores, character creation ability scores, alignment, and glossary definitions.

I also updated the conformance scaffold at [README.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/README.md:1) to mention the Markdown transcription.

# User_2026-05-02_0152_44

mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules is still on main. Can you take care of all the branching and committing for it?

Which repo is your commit message intended for? I almost want to try handing off commits to you for other repos too.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0152_59

I’ll handle the fixture repo branching locally. The commit message I gave was for the planning docs split across `weave` and `semantic-flow-framework`, not for `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`; I should have named that explicitly. For the fixture repo I’ll create the ladder branches as actual states, starting with `00-blank-slate` and `01-source-only`.

The fixture repo is clean and only has the initial README on `main`. I’m going to keep `main` untouched, create `00-blank-slate` at the current initial commit, then create `01-source-only` from it with only source-side files: README expansion, `NOTICE.md`, `ontology/`, and `shacl/`.

I’m adding the `01-source-only` state now. The files are deliberately plain source artifacts only: no `docs/` mesh yet, no generated pages, and no histories.

The first source files are written. I’m validating the Turtle now before committing, because a source-only branch still needs to be parse-clean.

The files parse, but I spotted a bad DC Terms IRI in the SHACL graph that a parser will not catch semantically. I’m fixing that before the commit.

I’m tightening `NOTICE.md` to avoid adding attribution language beyond the SRD’s required statement.

The `01-source-only` state is parse-clean. I’m committing it on the `01-source-only` branch now, leaving `00-blank-slate` at the initial scaffold commit.

The fixture branch state is clean and committed. I’m updating the Weave task checklist to reflect that the `01-source-only` branch now exists, but I’m not going to commit the `weave` or framework docs unless you explicitly want those repo commits too.

Done for `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules`.

Created local branches:

- `00-blank-slate` at the original initial commit `0d0755e`
- `01-source-only` with commit `9bb03b4`

`01-source-only` now contains:

- expanded `README.md`
- `NOTICE.md`
- `ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl`
- `shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl`

Validation:

- `riot --validate ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl` passed
- fixture repo is clean
- current checked-out branch is `01-source-only`
- I did not push branches to origin

The fixture commit is:

```text
Seed source-only fantasy rules fixture

- document the initial branch ladder and source-only fixture state
- add SRD attribution boundary in NOTICE.md
- add a small slash-IRI fantasy rules ontology seed
- add SHACL shapes for characters and ability scores
```

The earlier commit message I gave was intended for the planning-doc changes, not the fixture repo. More specifically, it covered changes in `weave` plus `semantic-flow-framework`. Those are still uncommitted right now:

- `weave`: modified `documentation/notes/wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md`
- `semantic-flow-framework`: untracked `examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/README.md`

Yes, you can hand repo-scoped commits off to me. The clean way is one explicit commit per repo, with me checking status first and avoiding unrelated dirty files.

# User_2026-05-02_0158_35

I do want a chance to review before we push in general, but I noticed you didn't push 00. should I do that?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0158_41

You don’t need to do it yourself unless you want to.

I didn’t push because your last request said “branching and committing,” not pushing, and pushing is the point where review matters. Locally, `00-blank-slate` exists and points at the same commit as `main`/`origin/main`, so there was no missing commit, just an unpublished branch name.

When you’re ready after review, the push would be:

```bash
git -C dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules push -u origin 00-blank-slate
git -C dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules push -u origin 01-source-only
```

I’d push both together after you review `01-source-only`; pushing `00` alone is harmless but not very useful without `01`.

# User_2026-05-02_0211_52

I want to adopt the convention of publishing a SF-compliant bit of version metadata in the ontology, as discussed in [[wa.conv.2026.2026-05-01_2227-picking-up-weave-codex]] but we can tackle that once we're ready to "release" the version. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg problem, as the dcterms:hasVersion  will be speculative until the mesh is woven. 

I'd expected this: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/terms/Character>
to look like: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/Character>
(to make it congruent with a prefix/base usage and convention.

Using full IRIs is clear, but any reason not to use prefixes here? e.g.:

@prefix: fr: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/>

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0212_13

I’ll update the source-only branch to use ontology-root slash terms and prefixes. I’m also checking the referenced conversation note so the version-metadata plan is recorded accurately without adding speculative release triples yet.

I agree with both points: no good reason to avoid prefixes in authored Turtle, and `/ontology/Character` is more congruent with the ontology namespace than a separate `/terms/` root. I’m changing the source branch and the planning docs to that convention, while leaving `dcterms:hasVersion` / `owl:versionIRI` out until a woven release can make those IRIs real.

The mechanical prefix rewrite mangled the first three Turtle declarations. I caught that in review; I’m fixing it and also removing the provisional `owl:versionInfo` so the source-only ontology does not pretend to have release metadata before the release branch exists.

The ontology source now uses `@base` plus `fr:` and the SHACL graph shares the same `fr:` namespace. I’m validating and then I’ll commit only the fixture repo change on `01-source-only`; the planning docs remain uncommitted for your review.

Agreed. Prefixes are better here, and `/ontology/Character` is the right convention for this fixture.

I updated `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` on `01-source-only` and committed:

```text
79a4310 Align fantasy rules namespace convention
```

Changes:
- `ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl` now uses:
  - `@base <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/> .`
  - `@prefix fr: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/> .`
- Term IRIs are now `fr:Character`, `fr:AbilityScore`, etc., resolving to `/ontology/Character`, `/ontology/AbilityScore`, etc.
- `shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl` uses the same `fr:` namespace.
- Removed provisional `owl:versionInfo`; no `dcterms:hasVersion` / `owl:versionIRI` until the release/weave branch materializes the target state and located file.

Validation passed:

```bash
riot --validate ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl
```

No push performed.

I also updated the uncommitted planning docs to record the `/ontology/...` term convention and the “defer version metadata until release/weave” rule. Current uncommitted docs remain:
- `weave`: `documentation/notes/wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md`
- `semantic-flow-framework`: `examples/sidecar-fantasy-rules/conformance/README.md`

# User_2026-05-02_0220_43

I'm not sure we capture it in the task note, but I want the ArtifactHistory to use "releases" (i.e., a custom ArtifactHistory name/segment) and the versions to use semantic versioning like "v0.0.1" (custom HistoricalState). The manifestation can use "ttl", so the SF locatedfile on first weave will look like ".../ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl". Probably need to update the API spec for the custom stuff? For a prefix, instead of "fr:" let's use "fant:"

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0221_06

I’ll make the prefix change in the fixture branch and update the planning/conformance docs to lock the release path as `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ttl/...`. I’ll also inspect the framework API spec before changing it, because the custom history/state naming may already be a Weave/runtime contract rather than an API surface.

I’ve got the source convention change committed once, but I still need to apply your `fant:` prefix preference and update release naming from `v0.1.0` to `v0.0.1`. I’m checking the API schema’s existing version request shape now, then I’ll make the smaller, defensible update rather than overloading the OpenAPI file prematurely.

The OpenAPI skeleton has `VersionJobRequest` and `WeaveJobRequest`, but no way to request release-style history/state names. Since this fixture is explicitly about custom `ArtifactHistory` and `HistoricalState` segments, I’m going to add a small optional `versioning` object rather than only leaving it in prose.

I’ll continue from the current workspace state: first verify the prefix/path edits landed cleanly, then tighten the API/spec docs around custom version naming and validate what changed.

The current runtime history/state naming already exists as `historySegment` and `stateSegment`; the public API contract is the missing piece. I’m going to model that as explicit optional versioning options and include `manifestationSegment` because the `ttl` segment is part of the publication path we want to assert.

I found one real implementation gap while documenting this: history/state segments are already implemented, but the current runtime derives manifestation segments from filenames. So I’m documenting `ttl` as the desired contract and making the task note call out the runtime/test work needed to make that path true.

The docs now record the custom release chain and the `fant:` prefix. I’m validating the authored Turtle plus the OpenAPI YAML next, then I’ll commit only the fixture repo prefix change on `01-source-only` unless validation exposes something.

One incidental change showed up: Deno updated the root `deno.lock` when I used it to parse the OpenAPI YAML. That’s not part of this task, so I’m removing only that accidental lockfile delta and leaving the intentional docs/spec changes intact.

Updated and validated.

- Committed fixture repo only: `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` on `01-source-only`, commit `c135963 Use fant prefix in source fixture`.
- Changed authored Turtle prefix from `fr:` to `fant:` in [fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl:2) and [fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl:1).
- Updated the task note to capture `releases / v0.0.1 / ttl`, the expected located file path, `fant:`, and the `manifestationSegment` runtime gap.
- Updated the framework API draft with `PathSegment`, `VersionNamingOptions`, and optional `versioning` on `version`/`weave`.
- Updated `sf.api.examples.md` and the sidecar conformance README with the same release-path convention.

Validation passed:

- `riot --validate ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl`
- OpenAPI YAML parsed with Deno
- `git diff --check` in `weave` and `semantic-flow-framework`

I did not push anything. Remaining uncommitted review items are in `weave` and `semantic-flow-framework`; the fixture repo is clean after the local commit. The main open issue I’d keep visible is that current Weave supports custom history/state segments, but `ttl` needs manifestation-segment support rather than the current filename-derived manifestation path.

# User_2026-05-02_0234_35

I think we should add manifestationSegment support. how does the current filename-derivation work? I think defaulting to the file extension is a good default.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0234_52

I’ll trace the version planning path before editing so the new segment option lands where filename-derived paths are currently created. The likely shape is `manifestationSegment?: string` on version targets, defaulting from the working filename extension when omitted.

The current derivation is exactly `fileName.replaceAll(".", "-")`, so `alice-bio.ttl` becomes manifestation `alice-bio-ttl`. That’s why the path today is `.../v0.0.1/alice-bio-ttl/alice-bio.ttl`; I agree that defaulting to the extension (`ttl`) is a cleaner default for typed manifestations.

I’m going to add explicit `manifestationSegment` support first and keep the existing default for this patch. Flipping the default from `alice-bio-ttl` to `ttl` would invalidate the Alice Bio conformance ladder and should be a small fixture-migration step rather than a hidden side effect of adding the option.

The core change has three parts: carry `manifestationSegment` through version-oriented targets, let payload version layout use it for new manifestation paths, and teach the runtime to read an existing latest snapshot from inventory instead of re-deriving that path blindly.

# User_2026-05-02_0238_16

If we make the change, we'll have to retrofit a bunch of stuff for alice AND we need to handle the case where there's no file extension.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0238_19

Agreed. I’m not flipping the default in this patch. I’m keeping filename-derived default behavior intact, adding explicit `manifestationSegment` support, and leaving “extension default plus no-extension fallback” as a separate migration so Alice Bio can be updated deliberately.

The explicit option is now threaded through core, runtime loading, and CLI. I’m running formatting and focused tests next; after that I’ll decide whether the broader suite is needed based on what fails.

The broad focused run exposed two expectation mistakes in the CLI tests, which I fixed. The remaining failures are in page-definition integration cases that don’t touch payload manifestation naming; I’ll run the exact affected tests now and keep that separate rather than mixing the signal.

Type checking passes. I’m running lint now, then I’ll review the diff for any accidental churn before deciding whether to commit this code slice.

# User_2026-05-02_0806_45

commit message for weave repo changes please

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0806_54

I’ll give you the message, but first I’m finishing the lint pass I’d already queued mentally so the message doesn’t overclaim verification.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0806_58

Lint found one real cleanup from the refactor: a now-unused `workingFilePath` parameter in the page list builder. I’m removing that before giving the commit text.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0807_28

Use this for the weave repo:

```text
Add payload manifestation version naming

- carry manifestationSegment through version-oriented targets and CLI payload naming
- use requested manifestation segments when planning payload snapshot files and resource pages
- resolve existing payload snapshot paths from state/manifestation RDF before falling back to filename-derived paths
- document that filename-derived manifestation defaults remain for now, with extension-derived defaults deferred

# User_2026-05-02_0847_45

should we do a PR to merge next/v0.0.1 to main?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0847_57

I’m checking the current branch state before answering, because the right PR timing depends on whether the code/docs are committed and whether the remaining test failures are from this slice or pre-existing page-definition cases.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0848_18

Yes, but I’d open it as a **draft PR**, not merge-ready yet.

Current state:

- `weave` is on `next/v0.0.1`, ahead of `origin/next/v0.0.1` by 2 commits.
- Branch diff to `main` is large: 51 files, many accumulated feature/docs commits.
- There is one uncommitted conversation note: `documentation/notes/wd.conv.2026.2026-05-02_0803-fantasy-rules-sidecar-planning-codex.md`.
- `deno task lint` passes.
- `deno task check` passes.
- Focused manifestation/version naming tests pass.
- A broader focused run still showed page-definition integration/e2e failures, so I would not mark it ready to merge until those are either fixed or confirmed as pre-existing branch debt.

Recommended PR posture:

```text
Draft PR: next/v0.0.1 -> main

Purpose:
- collect the v0.0.1 release branch work for review
- surface current CI status
- make remaining blockers explicit before merge
```

I’d clean up or commit the conversation note, push `next/v0.0.1`, open the draft PR, and put the known test status in the PR description.

# User_2026-05-02_0851_12

what's the known test status?

Also, I'm thinking to accumulate conversations in the weave-dev-archive repo moving forward. Or maybe the semantic-flow-framework repo. It moves them a little farther away from the code, which might be a problem for you and other LLMs, but keeps the weave repo focused. Conversations are cross-cutting, so doesn't totally make sense to have them all in weave.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0851_26

I’ll verify the remaining failures with a narrow filter so the status isn’t based only on the earlier broad run. That should distinguish the manifestation work from the page-definition debt.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0851_50

**Known Test Status**

Passing:

- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`
- Focused manifestation/version naming tests: `9 passed`
- Focused CLI payload version naming tests: `5 passed`

Known failing area:

- `tests/integration/weave_test.ts` page-definition/source-resolution cluster:
  - `executeWeave matches the settled alice page-customized-woven fixture`
  - artifact-backed page sources via `hasTargetArtifact`
  - artifact-backed page sources via `workingFilePath`
  - pinned artifact-backed page-source rejection
  - page definitions from `workingFilePath` literals
  - `targetMeshPath` escape denial
  - repo-adjacent `targetMeshPath` allow case

Latest narrow run: `1 passed, 7 failed, 19 filtered out`.

Those failures look page-definition / target source-resolution related, not payload `manifestationSegment` related.

**Conversation Archive**

I’d put raw conversations in `weave-dev-archive`, not `semantic-flow-framework`.

Reason: conversations are cross-cutting and mostly provenance/debug history, not framework API surface. The framework repo should carry distilled artifacts: API examples, conformance manifests, specs, decisions. The archive repo should carry transcripts.

To avoid making things hard for LLMs:

- keep short task/spec/decision notes in the owning repo
- link those notes to the relevant archived conversation
- keep `weave/AGENTS.md` pointing to the archive path
- use stable names like `wa.conv.2026...` in `weave-dev-archive/notes/`

So: raw chat in archive, distilled decisions near the code/spec they affect.

# User_2026-05-02_0854_20

If I link with dendron/wikilink style links (i.e., just the filename without md) can you easily find them cross-repos?

Do we need a task to address the failing tests? Should we do that before continuing with [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md) ?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0854_38

Yes, I can find Dendron/wikilink-style links across repos if the note filename is unique enough. I’ll usually `rg` the wikilink target across the workspace and vendored repos. The weak spot is ambiguity: `[[sf.api]]` or `[[wd.todo]]` is fine if naming is consistent, but cross-repo links are easier for LLMs and humans if the note id carries its repo namespace, like `wa.conv.*`, `sf.*`, `wd.*`, `ont.*`.

For rendered docs, cross-repo wikilinks only work if Dendron knows those vaults. For source navigation and LLM work, wikilinks are fine; for extra safety, add a short sentence naming the repo, e.g. “See [[wa.conv...]] in weave-dev-archive.”

On the failing tests: yes, I’d create a separate task. They are not fantasy-rules specific; they are page-definition/source-resolution regressions or drift on `next/v0.0.1`. I would make them a blocker for merging `next/v0.0.1` to `main`.

I would not block all fantasy sidecar work. Phase 0/Phase 1 fixture planning and source-only branch work can continue. But I would fix the failing page-definition tests before relying on generated pages, before claiming the sidecar weave phases are settled, and definitely before merging the release branch.

# User_2026-05-02_0857_19

OK, please fill out [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fix-failing-tests.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fix-failing-tests.md)

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0857_29

I’ll open the new task note and the local task template, then fill it with the current failing-test scope and merge-blocker criteria.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0857_36

The new note is just the skeleton right now. I couldn’t read the template through the vendored dependency path, so I’m locating the actual template path before patching the note.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0857_47

I’m going to replace the skeleton with a concrete blocker task: exact failing tests, observed failure modes, likely ownership, and a plan that separates this from the fantasy-rules fixture source work.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0858_36

Filled out [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fix-failing-tests.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fix-failing-tests.md).

It now captures the current passing checks, the exact failing command and 7-test failure cluster, the two observed failure modes, likely fixture/runtime drift questions, and an implementation plan. `git diff --check` passes for the new note.

I’ll make that directly in the fixture repo, then validate the Turtle so we don’t leave a dangling semicolon or malformed final triple.

There are 18 occurrences. I’m removing the statement and making the preceding predicate the block terminator in each case.

for all the "instance" terms like fant:Neutral or fant:Wisdom, we should probably use lower camel case to be consistent with RDF conventions: only classes get initial uppers.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0945_24

I’ll rename only the individual IRIs, leaving class and property terms as they are. Then I’ll validate the ontology and SHACL together so the fixture stays parseable.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0945_27

The fixture is clean on `01-source-only`. I’m applying the lower-camel rename for ability and alignment individuals now; labels stay human-readable.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0945_49

Validation passed. I’m committing this as another local source-fixture cleanup and won’t push it.

There are 13 redundant term-level statements after the ontology-level source. I’m removing those and fixing punctuation block-by-block.

let's add to [fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl) a "marker" shape that allows (but doesn't not require) schema:name

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1023_20

I’ll add `schema:` and an optional property shape on `fant:CharacterShape`. Since SHACL is open by default, this is mostly a documented/typed allowance; no `sh:minCount` means it won’t require `schema:name`.

# User_2026-05-02_1023_44

or actually characterName

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1023_52

I’ll switch that marker from `schema:name` to our own `fant:characterName`, and add the corresponding ontology datatype property so the SHACL path is defined. Still no `sh:minCount`, so it remains optional.

# User_2026-05-02_1024_20

Sorry, schema:characterName

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1024_28

No problem. I’ll move the optional marker to `schema:characterName` and remove the custom `fant:characterName` ontology property.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1025_00

Validation passed with `schema:characterName`. I’ll commit this optional SHACL marker locally.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1025_13

Updated [fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl) to add an optional marker property for `schema:characterName` on `fant:CharacterShape`.

No `sh:minCount`, so it’s allowed but not required. I kept `sh:datatype xsd:string`.

I’ll add it as an ontology datatype property and a SHACL constraint on `CharacterShape`: integer, optional, single-valued unless you’d rather allow multiple levels, with inclusive bounds 0 and 20.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1635_48

There’s an untracked `examples/` directory in the fixture repo, so I’ll leave that alone and only touch the ontology and SHACL files.

OK, and let's add fant:CharacterClass and use the below enumeration. You can ignore "Likes" and "Complexity", but add a fant:primaryAbility property, and appropriate SHACL constraints, including and vs or for primary ability.

Table: Class Overview
Class 	Likes 	Primary Ability 	Complexity
Barbarian 	Battle 	Strength 	Average
Bard 	Performing 	Charisma 	High
Cleric 	Gods 	Wisdom 	Average
Druid 	Nature 	Wisdom 	High
Fighter 	Weapons 	Strength or Dexterity 	Low
Monk 	Unarmed combat 	Dexterity and Wisdom 	High
Paladin 	Defense 	Strength and Charisma 	Average
Ranger 	Survival 	Dexterity and Wisdom 	Average
Rogue 	Stealth 	Dexterity 	Low
Sorcerer 	Power 	Charisma 	High
Warlock 	Occult lore 	Charisma 	High
Wizard 	Spellbooks 	Intelligence 	Average

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1642_55

I’ll model the class overview as `fant:CharacterClass` individuals plus a `fant:primaryAbility` relation. For the SHACL side I’ll keep the base `CharacterClassShape` simple, then add per-class node shapes that distinguish “or” classes from “and” classes.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1644_09

I’ll update the fixture ontology and SHACL in the sidecar repo only. I’m going to keep the class overview as source/reference data with repeated `fant:primaryAbility` values where the SRD lists more than one, then use SHACL node shapes to distinguish single-value, `or`, and `and` cases.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1644_23

The existing graph has a clean lower-camel pattern for individuals, so I’ll add `fant:barbarian` etc. as `fant:CharacterClass` instances. For Fighter I’ll model the table alternatives as two listed primary abilities, with SHACL allowing either listed ability; for Monk/Paladin/Ranger the shapes require both listed abilities.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1645_29

The edits are in place. I’m checking Turtle syntax and the patch shape now; if a SHACL validator is available locally I’ll run that too, otherwise I’ll at least do RDF syntax validation and whitespace checks.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1645_40

Syntax and whitespace checks passed. I’m doing one more local validation pass if the environment has a SHACL runner; otherwise this is limited to Turtle parsing.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1646_13

The SHACL graph validates the ontology as conforming with Jena’s `shacl validate`. I’m going to commit only the ontology and SHACL changes on `01-source-only`; the untracked `examples/` directory remains untouched.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1646_39

Added and committed in `mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` on `01-source-only`.

Changed:
- [fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl:44): added `fant:CharacterClass`, `fant:primaryAbility`, and the SRD class instances.
- [fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl:38): added class/primary-ability constraints, including separate `or` handling for Fighter and `and` handling for Monk, Paladin, and Ranger.

Validation:
- `riot --validate ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl`
- `shacl validate --shapes shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl --data ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl --text` returned `Conforms`
- `git diff --check`

No push. `examples/` is still untracked and untouched.

# User_2026-05-02_1655_30

Sorry, we haven't captured the fighter case: players have to choose strength or dexterity. Characters have a primaryAbility, not CharacterClasses. And SHACL constrains which.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1655_46

You’re right: putting `fant:primaryAbility` on `fant:CharacterClass` made the class overview look like reference metadata, but it doesn’t model the player choice. I’m going to move `primaryAbility` onto `Character`, add a `hasCharacterClass` link, keep class individuals as the enumeration, and make SHACL validate the allowed/required primary abilities per chosen class.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1656_39

I found the prior commit is clean except for the conceptual issue you flagged. I’m going to replace the class-targeted primary ability shapes with character-targeted choice shapes, because otherwise the ontology cannot express “this Fighter character chose Dexterity” versus “the Fighter class lists two options.”

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1658_25

The ontology now has no class-level `primaryAbility` facts; the class nodes are just the enumeration. I’m validating both syntax and the revised SHACL behavior, including a focused check that a Fighter with both Strength and Dexterity fails.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1659_04

The focused check behaved correctly: a Fighter choosing Dexterity conforms, and a Fighter with both Strength and Dexterity produces an `sh:or` violation. I’m doing the normal ontology-as-data validation now, then I’ll commit the correction separately.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1659_22

The correction is coherent now: `fant:hasCharacterClass` selects the class, `fant:primaryAbility` lives on the character, and Fighter’s shape requires exactly one of Strength or Dexterity. I’m committing this as a follow-up fix rather than rewriting the existing local branch history.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1659_39

Corrected and committed as `1d77ec3 Move primary ability choices to characters`.

What changed:
- [fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl:73): added `fant:hasCharacterClass`.
- [fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/ontology/fantasy-rules-ontology.ttl:79): changed `fant:primaryAbility` domain to `fant:Character`.
- Removed `fant:primaryAbility` facts from the `fant:CharacterClass` individuals.
- [fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/shacl/fantasy-rules-shacl.ttl:50): replaced class-node constraints with character-node class/primary-ability choice constraints.

Validation:
- Turtle syntax passed with `riot --validate`.
- SHACL ontology validation returned `Conforms`.
- Focused temp check: Fighter with Dexterity conforms; Fighter with both Strength and Dexterity fails with an `sh:or` violation.

No push. `examples/` remains untracked and untouched.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1702_20

The example is written. I’m validating the Turtle and checking it against the SHACL graph with the ontology included as data so the referenced classes and abilities are present.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1702_40

The file parses, but my first combined SHACL validation used a nameless temp file and Jena could not infer its RDF syntax. I’m rerunning that with a `.ttl` suffix and then I’ll commit the example file only.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1702_58

`examples/` contains only `gunaar.ttl`, and the combined ontology-plus-example SHACL validation returns `Conforms`. I’m committing this as a source-only example fixture now.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_1703_08

Generated and committed [gunaar.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules/examples/gunaar.ttl:1).

It models Gunaar as a level 2 Barbarian with `fant:primaryAbility fant:strength` and all six ability scores.

Validation passed:
- `riot --validate examples/gunaar.ttl`
- combined ontology + example SHACL validation returned `Conforms`
- `git diff --check`
