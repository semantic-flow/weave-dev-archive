weave alice bio integrated woven

Any questions about [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]] 

 I’d start implementation context from: 

product-vision.md
wd.general-guidance.md
wd.testing.md
wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1422_10

I’m reviewing the task note and the core guidance/spec files you named so I can identify concrete ambiguities before implementation. Then I’ll give you a short list of questions, or say the scope is already tight enough to proceed.

I’ve confirmed the repo is clean. Next I’m reading the task note plus the vision, guidance, testing, and behavior spec to check for missing decisions or conflicts before touching code.

The task note is specific, but I want one more pass through the existing `weave`/`integrate` implementation and the ontology summary before I decide whether the remaining uncertainty is real or just already encoded in code/tests.

I’ve got the note set. Now I’m checking the carried `05`/`06` implementation and acceptance harness, because the best questions here are about seams and invariants the code already hard-codes, not generic scope questions.

I’m looking at the actual `06 -> 07` fixture delta now. That’s where the real unanswered questions show up, if any: target selection, page surface, and whether the working/current bytes invariant is strict in this slice.

I found one real tension: the broad weave behavior note includes later, richer page-generation rules that the settled `07` fixture does not yet implement. I’m pulling exact line references so I can make that question concrete instead of hand-wavy.

I have the main ambiguity. I’m pulling one last code reference for the current validation behavior so I can frame the second question precisely instead of relying on memory.

Two real questions. Otherwise the note is specific enough to start.

1. Fixture-first or broader page-spec-first for `07`?
The task note says to keep this slice narrow and explicitly avoid “later richer page generation work” while introducing only a minimal shared page seam: [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L22]], [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L76]]. But the reused weave behavior note already contains later-generation rules like “identifier pages should say what the identifier denotes” and “history landing pages should list all states”: [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior#L221]], [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior#L245]]. The `07` Accord manifest, though, pins exact text for the current minimal HTML pages: [07-alice-bio-integrated-woven.jsonld](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/07-alice-bio-integrated-woven.jsonld#L77).  
My default would be: treat the settled `07` fixture/manifest as authoritative for this slice, and defer the richer page rules to a later task.

2. How strong should `validate` be in this slice?
The behavior spec says weave validation should include more than parseability, including merged-graph / ontology or SHACL expectations: [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior#L108]]. The current runtime only parses generated Turtle before writing files: [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L64), [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L273).  
My default would be: keep `07` at parse-only runtime validation, but add explicit tests for the payload/current-history invariants.

I’m not blocked on request shape. Unless you want to pay the abstraction cost now, I’d keep `designatorPaths` narrow for this slice as the task already suggests: [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven#L86]].

# User_2026-04-04_1428_00

Richer page rules can be deferred. parse-only runtime validation is fine for now. 

Proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1428_12

I’m proceeding with the `06 -> 07` slice using the defaults you set: fixture-first page output and parse-only runtime validation. Next I’m mapping the exact code changes for planning, runtime materialization, and the shared page-render seam before I patch anything.

Plan for the patch:
1. Generalize `core/weave` from the current first-knop slice to a narrow artifact-targeted `06 -> 07` payload weave planner.
2. Move page shaping out of inline HTML in `core` into a shared runtime page renderer, and route both the existing `05` pages and new `07` pages through it.
3. Extend unit, integration, and e2e acceptance tests to the `07` fixture, then run the targeted Deno test set.

I’ve got the implementation shape. The main extra requirement for `07` is that the runtime has to load the working payload bytes so the planner can snapshot them into payload history without moving the working file. I’m checking the framework example surface too so I can tell whether this slice actually sharpens the public contract or not.

I’m patching the weave core/runtime boundary now. The goal is to keep the planner responsible for slice detection and page models, while the runtime owns HTML rendering and file materialization.

I’m adding the shared runtime page renderer first, then rewiring `core/weave` to emit page models instead of inline HTML. After that I’ll extend the planner for the payload slice and lock it down with tests.

The planner patch is in. I’m wiring runtime candidate loading and page rendering to that new plan shape now, then I’ll hit the unit/integration/e2e updates together so the slice is exercised end to end.

I’m on the test pass now. I’m keeping the existing `04 -> 05` coverage and adding `06 -> 07` alongside it so the page seam refactor doesn’t silently regress the first weave slice.

The code and tests are patched. I’m running the weave-focused test set now to catch type drift and fixture mismatches before I touch the notes.

The first pass is still running. If there’s drift, it’ll almost certainly be in the new plan shape or an exact HTML/Turtle fixture mismatch, so I’m waiting on those results before I do the documentation close-out.

The first failure is narrow: `@std/path` in this repo version doesn’t export `posix` from the root module. I’m switching the page renderer to the stdlib posix submodule and rerunning the same checks.

The code type-checks now. The remaining failures are test-harness related: one unit test is pulling fixture content through `git`, and the raw `deno test` invocation doesn’t include the env/run permissions some existing integration paths already need. I’m switching to the repo’s intended test task and trimming the unit test so it stays permission-light.

Formatting is done. I’m waiting on the permissioned weave test run now; if it comes back clean, I’ll do the repo-level `check`/`test` pass and then update the task/spec/overview notes.

The weave slice itself is green. I’m waiting on the full repo task runs now so I can be sure the refactor didn’t nick the existing mesh/knop/integrate paths before I update the notes and rename the task.

The code path is complete and the repo-level checks are green. I’m doing the close-out pass now: task note status, spec clarification for the minimal-page/parse-validation posture, decision log, and overview.

I found one real documentation inconsistency worth fixing as part of close-out: the weave behavior note still implied later richer pages and stronger validation applied uniformly to early slices. I’m tightening that so the spec matches the carried `05` and `07` behavior instead of leaving the contradiction in place.

I’ve updated the content of the close-out note. I’m renaming it from `wd.task.*` to `wd.completed.*` now so the repo state matches the task status, then I’ll run one final format/check/test sweep.

I found one last repo-hygiene item from the rename: a conversation note still links to the old `wd.task.*` name. I’m updating only those references, without touching the unrelated note churn already in the worktree.

The code hasn’t changed since the green run, but I’m doing one final repo `check`/`test` sweep after the note rename so the turn closes with a fresh clean verification state.

Implemented the `06 -> 07` Alice Bio payload weave slice and moved page HTML out of `core` into a shared runtime renderer. The main code is in [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave.ts), [weave.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and [pages.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages.ts). `weave` now handles both carried slices: the earlier `04 -> 05` Knop weave and the new `06 -> 07` payload weave, including payload snapshot history, payload-Knop histories, `_mesh/_inventory` advancement to `_s0003`, and the settled minimal `alice/bio` page surface.

I also added coverage for the new slice in [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), [pages_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/src/runtime/weave/pages_test.ts), [weave_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/integration/weave_test.ts), and [weave_cli_test.ts](/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts). The task note is now [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-weave-alice-bio-integrated-woven]], and I updated [[wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior]], [[wd.codebase-overview]], and [[wd.decision-log]] to reflect the minimal-page and parse-only-validation posture for the carried local runtime. No framework API example change was needed.

Verification: `deno task check` and `deno task test` both passed.

The worktree already had unrelated documentation churn and note renames; I left those intact.

feat(weave): carry alice/bio integrated-woven slice

- extend shared `weave` planning/runtime from the first Knop-only slice to the settled `06-alice-bio-integrated` -> `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` payload slice
- add first payload-artifact history materialization for `alice/bio` while preserving `alice-bio.ttl` as the working file and snapshotting matching payload bytes under `alice/bio/_history001/_s0001/...`
- version `alice/bio/_knop/_meta` and `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory`, and advance `_mesh/_inventory` to `_s0003` when the public current surface expands
- move ResourcePage HTML rendering behind a shared runtime page seam so both the carried `05` and `07` weave slices use the same page-model -> HTML path
- keep current local weave validation narrow at generated-RDF parse validation rather than introducing broader merged-graph or SHACL validation in this slice
- add unit, integration, and black-box CLI acceptance coverage for the settled `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` manifest while preserving the earlier `05` weave coverage
- update weave notes and decisions to record the new carried slice, the shared page-render seam, and the current fixture-first minimal-page posture

OK, time to create the next task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-04_1520_21

I’m checking the current todo/task notes before recommending the next task. The main question is whether the next highest-leverage move is the next semantic slice (`08`) or a shared infrastructure cleanup like RDF parsing.

The current todo note is empty, and the next settled semantic slice after `07` is `08-alice-bio-referenced`, not the RDF-parsing cleanup. I’m checking the existing task/spec pattern for non-woven operations so I can draft the right next task note instead of creating a vague placeholder.

The answer is yes, but I don’t think the next task should be RDF parsing. That’s a real cleanup task, but it’s not the next carried semantic slice. The next task should be the first local `07 -> 08` reference-catalog slice, and I’m drafting that note now in the same style as the earlier carried-slice tasks.

The `08` fixture has one surprising detail: it also modifies `alice/_knop/_meta/_history001/_s0001/meta-ttl/meta.ttl`, not just inventory plus the new references file. I’m checking that before I write the task note, because if that change is just timestamp churn or a corrective retcon, it should be called out instead of silently baked in.

I’m writing the new task note as the next carried semantic slice and adding it to `wd.todo` so the queue is explicit. I’m also calling out the whitespace-only fixture diff as non-behavior, because that should not steer the implementation.

The next task note is in place and `wd.todo` now points at it plus the separate RDF-parsing cleanup. I’m doing a quick read-back of the new note so I can catch any naming or scope mistake before I hand it off.

Yes.

I created the next carried-slice note at [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04-alice-bio-referenced]] and added it to [[wd.todo]]. I scoped it to the settled `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven -> 08-alice-bio-referenced` transition: first `alice` `ReferenceCatalog`, one canonical `ReferenceLink` about `<alice>` targeting `<alice/bio>`, with no weave/history/page-generation behavior yet.

I also pushed back on one point in the note: `RDF parsing` is still a valid task, but it should stay a separate cleanup track, not replace the next carried semantic slice. The next concrete move after this note is to write the dedicated reference-behavior spec that the task calls for.
