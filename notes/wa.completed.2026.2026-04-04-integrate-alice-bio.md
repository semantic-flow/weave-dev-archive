## Goals

- Carry the next real local semantic slice after the first completed `weave` implementation.
- Implement the first local or in-process `integrate` path over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Reuse the same fixture-driven unit, integration, and black-box acceptance pattern used for the first carried slices.
- Keep the first `integrate` implementation narrow enough to prove payload integration behavior without absorbing the subsequent `weave` responsibilities.

## Summary

This task picks up after the completed local `04-alice-knop-created` -> `05-alice-knop-created-woven` `weave` slice.

The next carried slice should be the first local `integrate` implementation, targeting the settled Alice Bio transition from `05-alice-knop-created-woven` to `06-alice-bio-integrated`.

The target behavior is deliberately narrow:

- add the `alice/bio` payload artifact to the current mesh surface
- keep the working payload bytes at the existing root `alice-bio.ttl` path
- create `alice/bio/_knop/_meta/meta.ttl`
- create `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl`
- update `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` to register the integrated payload artifact and its Knop
- leave page generation, explicit histories, and other weave behavior for the following `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` slice

This task should prove the first real payload-integration path without folding in later extraction, reference management, or payload weaving behavior.

## Discussion

### Why this is the next slice

The settled fixture ladder models `06-alice-bio-integrated` as the direct semantic result of `integrate`, with `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` reserved for the later `weave` pass.

That makes `05` -> `06` the next missing implementation-bearing step after the first completed local `weave` slice.

Jumping straight to `07` would blur the same boundary the fixture ladder is trying to preserve:

- `integrate` changes the current semantic surface
- `weave` versions, validates, and generates that current surface afterward

### Why this first integrate slice should stay narrow

The settled `06` fixture is intentionally modest.

It adds the new `alice/bio` payload artifact and the payload Knop support artifacts, but it does not yet:

- create payload history
- create `alice/bio/index.html`
- create `alice/bio/_knop/.../index.html`
- auto-create `bob` resources from the referenced IRI in the payload
- move the working Turtle bytes away from the repo root

That narrow scope is useful because it proves the payload-artifact association behavior directly without conflating it with later versioning or rendering work.

### Existing fixture guidance

The settled fixture and conformance notes already pin down two important expectations for this slice:

- the working payload bytes remain at `alice-bio.ttl` in the non-woven `06` state
- referenced-resource extraction behavior such as auto-creating `bob` should stay out of this first baseline integration slice

That means the first local `integrate` implementation should be driven primarily by the settled `06-alice-bio-integrated` fixture and manifest, with additional prose only where the behavior still needs clarification.

## Resolved Questions

- `integrate` should get a dedicated `wd.spec.*` note before implementation. Unlike the first `weave` slice, there is no existing behavior note to reuse, and the `05` -> `06` transition is already an externally visible cross-subsystem boundary with a manifest-backed acceptance target.
- The first local CLI surface should take the source as the primary positional input and require `designatorPath` either as a second positional argument or via `--designator-path`. The current slice should resolve `meshBase` from the existing workspace mesh support surface rather than asking users to repeat it.
- The filesystem-separation tension should be resolved by keeping host paths out of `core`. The local CLI/runtime may accept a local path or `file:` URL as the source input, but shared `core` planning should operate on the resulting mesh-relative working file path that becomes the payload artifact's `hasWorkingLocatedFile`.
- The first public `integrate` request/result examples in `semantic-flow-framework` should stay thin: identify the existing mesh, one `designatorPath`, and one source URI, then report only created and updated semantic resources. Host filesystem paths, copy or staging policy, and later remote-fetch behavior should stay out of the thin core contract.

## Decisions

- Treat `05-alice-knop-created-woven` -> `06-alice-bio-integrated` as the next carried implementation slice.
- Use the settled Alice Bio `06-alice-bio-integrated` manifest and fixture as the first acceptance target.
- Add a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-integrate-behavior]] note for this slice rather than leaving the operation semantics implicit in the fixture diff alone.
- Keep the first `integrate` implementation local or in-process over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Make the first local CLI surface `weave integrate <path-or-file-url> [designatorPath]` with `--designator-path` as the explicit option form, and resolve `meshBase` from the existing workspace.
- Keep host filesystem paths out of shared `core` by planning `integrate` from `designatorPath` plus a mesh-relative working file path, while leaving room for later runtime staging from remote sources.
- Keep the working payload bytes at `alice-bio.ttl` for this first slice rather than relocating the file before the woven step.
- Do not absorb payload weaving, page generation, explicit histories, referenced-resource extraction, or daemon work into this task.

## Contract Changes

- This task may introduce the first thin public request/result examples for `integrate` in `semantic-flow-framework`, including a semantic source-URI input without standardizing host filesystem paths.
- This task should not broaden the public API beyond what the first local payload-integration slice actually proves.

## Testing

- Follow [[wd.testing]].
- Add failing unit tests for narrow `integrate` planning logic where practical.
- Add integration tests for local filesystem results against the settled `06-alice-bio-integrated` fixture target.
- Add a black-box CLI acceptance test scoped by the settled `06-alice-bio-integrated` Accord manifest.
- Keep the comparison black-box and fixture-oriented rather than coupling tests to internal helper structure.

## Non-Goals

- implementing the `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` weave behavior
- creating payload history or historical snapshot files
- generating `alice/bio` or payload-Knop HTML pages
- auto-creating `bob` or other referenced-resource Knops
- introducing reference-catalog behavior
- moving or copying the working payload bytes away from `alice-bio.ttl`
- implementing daemon endpoints

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Decide whether `integrate` needs a dedicated `wd.spec.*` note before implementation.
- [x] Define the first local request/result shapes for `integrate` in shared `core` and `runtime`.
- [x] Define the exact first local CLI surface for the carried `integrate` operation.
- [x] Add failing unit and integration tests for the first `integrate` behavior.
- [x] Implement the first local or in-process `integrate` path over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- [x] Add a black-box CLI acceptance test scoped by the settled `06-alice-bio-integrated` Accord manifest.
- [x] Draft the first thin public API example or contract fragment for `integrate` in `semantic-flow-framework` if this slice sharpens the public contract.
- [x] Update relevant overview/spec/framework notes as the slice settles.

## coderabbit review

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

In `@src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts`:
- [x] Preserve a single explicitly provided logger in `resolveLoggers` instead of discarding it when the other logger is absent. Reason: `ExecuteIntegrateOptions` makes `operationalLogger` and `auditLogger` independently optional, so the current implementation is a real correctness bug rather than just a style issue.
- [c] Rewrite `describeIntegrateResult` for singular/plural polish. Reason: the current wording is slightly awkward, but it is low-signal CLI text and not worth reopening this otherwise-settled slice by itself.

---

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts`:
- [c] Make `assertUpdatedTargetsExist` async instead of using `Deno.statSync`. Reason: this is a very small preflight check over a tiny file set, so the sync call is not a meaningful problem in the current local slice.
- [c] Replace regex `meshBase` extraction in this task with an RDF parse. Reason: the robustness concern is real, but the same pattern exists in sibling runtime loaders, so this should be addressed as a shared follow-up rather than as an integrate-only tweak.
