picking up weave

It's been several weeks, and I'm at a bit of a loss for where we're at. I have two thoughts:
- another repository, similar to mesh-alice-bio, but where the weave site lives in docs, for the use case where a semantic mesh sits adjacent to the files it represents
- I want to use Semantic Flow with the URPX ontology I'm helping flux tailor develop. It's going to have the main ontology and the SHACL that should be dereferenceable, and for the identifying IRIs and versionIRI, we'd currently planned to do something like this:

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology> a owl:Ontology ;
    rdfs:label "URPX Ontology"@en ;
    dcterms:creator "Klaar De Schepper, Una Smithsimon, Flux Tailor LLC" ;

    ] .

I want to figure out what the Semantic-Flow equivalents would be, especially for the  https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/v0.2.0/shacl and https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/v0.2.0/ontology which basically would correspond to digital artifact versions.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2202_40

I’ll re-orient from the repo’s own guidance first, then trace the existing artifact/version vocabulary so the URPX mapping is grounded in what Weave already says.

The repo’s guidance says the ontology is the center of gravity here, and the roadmap is currently focused around page generation, imports, and version/source semantics. I’m going to inspect the ontology summary plus the implementation vocabulary for artifacts, versions, meshes, and page sources before making a recommendation.

The important live model is `DigitalArtifact -> ArtifactHistory -> HistoricalState -> ArtifactManifestation -> LocatedFile`. That already sounds like the right Semantic Flow counterpart to your `releases/v0.2.0/...` nodes, but I’m checking the exact properties and current fixture shapes before saying how I’d model URPX.

One thing I’d push back on up front: the DCAT dataset nodes are useful publication metadata, but in Semantic Flow they should not replace the artifact state nodes. For Weave, the durable “versioned artifact” identity is likely `HistoricalState`; DCAT can describe that state’s distribution/download URL.

The carried fixture repo is ahead of the local checked-out branch: local `mesh-alice-bio` is at `13`, but remote fixture branches go through `25`. The Weave code/tests know about those later branches, so “where we’re at” is not just the visible local checkout.

I found one inconsistency to keep in mind: the live runtime/fixtures use legacy `sflo:` for the main artifact model and `sfc:` for newer page-source terms, while the vendored ontology TTL has already moved some terms under `ontology/core` and still contains older `hasSource*` names. I would not base URPX modeling on that TTL verbatim without a namespace/vocabulary cleanup pass.

I re-oriented from the repo notes and did not change files.

Where Weave is at: the product vision is still a filesystem-oriented Semantic Flow reference implementation for dereferenceable identifiers, `DigitalArtifact`s, and `SemanticMesh`es ([product-vision.md](product-vision.md:9)). The live mental model is:

`DigitalArtifact -> ArtifactHistory -> HistoricalState -> ArtifactManifestation -> LocatedFile`

That is the important mapping for your URPX release/version question ([ont.summary.core.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.summary.core.md:54)).

For URPX, I would map:

- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology` = the governing `DigitalArtifact` / `PayloadArtifact` for the ontology, also `owl:Ontology` and `RdfDocument`.
- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases` = its `ArtifactHistory`.
- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0` = the `HistoricalState`, equivalent to your `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/v0.2.0/ontology` version dataset node.
- a manifestation/distribution node below that = the Turtle distribution.
- the raw GitHub URL = a download URL / located file, not the version identity.

Same shape for SHACL:

- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl`
- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl/releases`
- `https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl/releases/v0.2.0`

I would push back on this part of the draft:

```turtle
owl:versionIRI <https://github.com/urpx-org/urpx/raw/v0.2.0/ontology/urpx-ontology.ttl>
```

That makes the version identity be a GitHub file distribution. I’d prefer:

```turtle
owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0> ;
dcat:distribution [
  dcat:downloadURL <https://github.com/urpx-org/urpx/raw/v0.2.0/ontology/urpx-ontology.ttl>
] .
```

If OWL tooling absolutely needs `owl:versionIRI` to fetch Turtle directly, then either make the Semantic Flow historical-state IRI dereference to RDF, or use the located Turtle file IRI pragmatically. But conceptually, Semantic Flow’s version node is `HistoricalState`, not the raw file URL.

Current Weave already supports custom payload history/state path segments, but only in the artifact-centric form: `ontology/releases/v0.2.0`, not the global-release form `releases/v0.2.0/ontology` ([payload-version-naming.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_1852-payload-version-naming.md:40)). If you really want the global release layout, that is a separate release-aggregate/layout feature, not just a naming option.

Your “site lives in `docs/` adjacent to represented files” repo idea is on target. I’d make it a separate fixture repo because it tests a different topology than `mesh-alice-bio`: mesh root at `docs/`, source ontology/SHACL outside `docs/`, and repo access policy allowing `../ontology/...` and `../shacl/...`. That lines up with the operational-config work, where `workingFilePath` and `targetMeshPath` already have local-boundary behavior, while `workingAccessUrl` and `targetAccessUrl` are still metadata/model-only for now ([operational config](wd.task.2026.2026-04-11_1723-operational-config-for-runtime-resolution.md:30)).

One warning before using this for URPX: there is a vocabulary/namespace cleanup needed. Runtime currently expects newer page terms like `hasTargetArtifact` ([page_definition.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/page_definition.ts:22)), while the vendored ontology TTL still has older `hasSourceArtifact` names ([semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl:532)). I would settle that before treating Weave-generated RDF as publication-grade.

# User_2026-05-01_2215_07

By unfortunate convetion, versionIRI is supposed to point to bytes. We could consider, for semantic flow, being able to use any URL for the LocatedFile (maybe we specify a "primary" located files) since those things aren't dereferenceable to ResourcePages anyhow.

I don't see any huge reason not to switch from releases/v0.2.0/ontology to releases/ontology/v0.2.0 -- it gives us more flexibility for independent versioning.  

Regarding your warning, I think that might be fixed after pulling the latest ontology commits.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2215_26

I’ll check the sibling ontology repo and the vendored copy Weave currently reads, then compare the page-source vocabulary against runtime expectations. That will tell us whether the warning is already resolved upstream or whether Weave still needs a dependency update.

The vendored ontology copy under Weave already has the `hasTargetArtifact` / `ArtifactResolutionTarget` vocabulary, so that warning is stale for this checkout. The sibling `ontology` repo I checked is a different older-layout repo with local modifications, so I’m not going to pull or merge there without an explicit instruction.

You’re right on `owl:versionIRI`. OWL 2 says the ontology document for a version should be accessible via the version IRI, so tooling tends to treat it as a document URL, not just an abstract version node. Source: W3C OWL 2 Structural Spec, sections 3.1-3.2: https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Ontology_IRI_and_Version_IRI

So I’d split it this way:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology>
  a owl:Ontology, sflo:PayloadArtifact, sflo:DigitalArtifact, sflo:RdfDocument ;
  owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0/urpx-ontology.ttl> ;
  sflo:currentArtifactHistory <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology>
  a sflo:ArtifactHistory ;
  sflo:latestHistoricalState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0>
  a sflo:HistoricalState ;
  sflo:locatedFileForState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0/urpx-ontology.ttl> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0/urpx-ontology.ttl>
  a sflo:LocatedFile, sflo:RdfDocument .
```

Same pattern for SHACL:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl>
  a owl:Ontology, sh:ShapesGraph, sflo:PayloadArtifact, sflo:DigitalArtifact, sflo:RdfDocument ;
  owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/shacl/v0.2.0/urpx-shacl.ttl> ;
  sflo:currentArtifactHistory <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/shacl> .
```

I agree `releases/ontology/v0.2.0` is better than `releases/v0.2.0/ontology` if ontology and SHACL can version independently. The only pushback is that Weave’s currently implemented custom naming naturally produces `ontology/releases/v0.2.0`, because histories are artifact-local. If you want the shared top-level `releases/ontology/v0.2.0` layout, that is a small but real layout feature, not just a spelling change.

On `LocatedFile`: yes, I think a `LocatedFile` should be allowed to be any retrievable URL. If there are multiple located files for one manifestation, adding something like `sflo:primaryLocatedFile` or `sflo:canonicalLocatedFile` is probably cleaner than overloading `locatedFileForState`.

And yes, the ontology warning appears fixed in the vendored Weave copy: it now has `hasTargetArtifact`, `ArtifactResolutionTarget`, `targetMeshPath`, `workingAccessUrl`, etc. I didn’t pull the sibling ontology repo because it has local modifications.

# User_2026-05-01_2224_36

To be SF-conventional, would it be:

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases> 
  a sflo:ArtifactHistory ;
  sflo:latestHistoricalState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/releases/ontology/v0.2.0> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0> 
  a sflo:HistoricalState ;
  sflo:locatedFileForState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/urpx-ontology.ttl> . 

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/urpx-ontology.ttl> 
  a sflo:LocatedFile, sflo:RdfDocument .

And for good measure, we could add a manifestation:

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/> a sflo:ArtifactManifestation

and then update the located File IRI to https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2224_58

Yes. That is more SF-conventional than my earlier `.../releases/ontology/...` sketch because the history sits under the artifact identity:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases>
  a sflo:ArtifactHistory ;
  sflo:latestHistoricalState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0>
  a sflo:HistoricalState ;
  sflo:hasManifestation <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl> ;
  sflo:locatedFileForState <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl>
  a sflo:ArtifactManifestation, sflo:RdfDocument ;
  sflo:hasLocatedFile <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl>
  a sflo:LocatedFile, sflo:RdfDocument .
```

I’d use `.../ttl` rather than `.../ttl/` as the canonical manifestation IRI, with `.../ttl/index.html` as its ResourcePage if needed. The actual bytes URL can and should have the file extension.

Then `owl:versionIRI` can point at the located file:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology>
  owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl> .
```

And `sflo:currentArtifactHistory` / `sflo:hasArtifactHistory` would point from the artifact to `<.../ontology/releases>`.

# User_2026-05-01_2228_29

But not all of that SF-specific detail needs to sit in the actual ontology. We would just use the historical state for the version identifier and of course use the abstract digitalartifact IRI for the actual ontology and shacl.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2228_51

Yes. I’d keep the actual URPX ontology and SHACL files mostly standard and let the Semantic Flow mesh/inventory carry the richer artifact graph.

Minimal published ontology header:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology>
  a owl:Ontology, sflo:DigitalArtifact ;
  dcterms:hasVersion <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0> ;
  owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl> .
```

Then the SF mesh can know:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology>
  sflo:hasArtifactHistory <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases> ;
  sflo:currentArtifactHistory <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases> .

<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0>
  a sflo:HistoricalState ;
  sflo:hasManifestation <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl> .
```

Same for SHACL:

```turtle
<https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl>
  a owl:Ontology, sh:ShapesGraph, sflo:DigitalArtifact ;
  dcterms:hasVersion <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl/releases/v0.2.0> ;
  owl:versionIRI <https://urpx-org.github.io/urpx/shacl/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-shacl.ttl> .
```

The one nuance: in Semantic Flow, the version identity is the `HistoricalState`; in OWL tooling, `owl:versionIRI` is expected to be dereferenceable as the ontology document. So either:

- point `owl:versionIRI` at the located Turtle file for maximum tool compatibility, while `dcterms:hasVersion` points at the SF historical state, or
- make the historical-state IRI itself dereference/redirect/content-negotiate to the Turtle bytes, then use it as `owl:versionIRI`.

I’d pick the first unless you specifically want the historical-state URL to be the OWL document URL too.

# User_2026-05-01_2238_46

ok, so circling back to the "adjacent" repo-fixture, it's tempting to use a faux-ontology for it. I'm thinking about the use of "github raw" URLs as IRIs for LocatedFiles, like whether they must be copied into the mesh or whether we allow a mode where they can just continue to live in a specified place. Or whether we can just keep things flexible.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2239_07

I’d keep the model flexible, but make the operational modes explicit.

A `sflo:LocatedFile` can absolutely be a GitHub raw URL. The ontology should not require every located file to be copied into the mesh. But Weave should distinguish:

1. **Adjacent working file**
   Use this for the repo-fixture you’re describing.

   ```turtle
   <https://example.github.io/project/ontology>
     a sflo:DigitalArtifact, sflo:PayloadArtifact, sflo:RdfDocument ;
     sflo:workingFilePath "../ontology/example-ontology.ttl" .
   ```

   The mesh lives in `docs/`; the ontology source stays in `ontology/`. Runtime policy allows `../ontology/`. When woven/versioned, the historical snapshot can be materialized under `docs/ontology/releases/v0.1.0/...`.

2. **Remote located file**
   Use this when the bytes really live elsewhere and should remain there.

   ```turtle
   <https://example.github.io/project/ontology/releases/v0.1.0/ttl/example-ontology.ttl>
     a sflo:LocatedFile, sflo:RdfDocument ;
     dcat:downloadURL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/v0.1.0/ontology/example-ontology.ttl> .
   ```

   Or the raw URL itself can be the `LocatedFile` IRI. I slightly prefer a stable SF/public IRI for the `LocatedFile`, with `dcat:downloadURL` pointing to GitHub raw, because it keeps denotation under your control.

3. **Imported copy**
   Use this when the mesh needs reproducibility/offline behavior or page generation follows the bytes. This is the Bob import-boundary model: remote origin is metadata; local governed copy is what Weave follows.

The fixture should probably test mode 1 first: a `docs/` mesh with adjacent source files outside `docs/`. That is the cleanest “semantic mesh adjacent to represented files” case and avoids pretending every source must be imported. A faux ontology is fine, but I’d make it a small real Turtle ontology plus a small SHACL file so we exercise `owl:versionIRI`, `sh:ShapesGraph`, `RdfDocument`, and versioned payload behavior without pulling URPX complexity in.

One pushback: avoid branch-based GitHub raw URLs for version identifiers or immutable located files. If you use GitHub raw, use a release tag or commit SHA. Branch raw URLs are working/current locators, not historical located files.

# User_2026-05-01_2241_17

yes, the workingFilePath is pretty clear in my mind... the workingFile only lives in one place. But for historical locatedfiles, I'd always imagined that (if versioning was turned on) they always get copied into the mesh. I don't see much harm in copying them in for most use cases, but we might have to modify a specification or something if we allow to not be copied-on-weave.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2241_27

I’m going to anchor this in the current spec/task notes rather than answer from memory, because copy-on-weave is exactly the kind of invariant that can be implicit in tests and easy to break accidentally.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2241_36

The existing spec does treat historical snapshots as materialized files in the mesh, and it also treats current remote/direct locators as policy-gated and not followed by page generation. So allowing non-copied historical located files would be a contract change, not just a modeling relaxation.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2241_45

Yes. Current Weave semantics assume copy-on-weave for historical states. The clearest existing contract says weave should “preserve the working file as the current surface while also materializing the corresponding historical snapshot,” and that the current working Turtle file should be byte-identical to the latest historical-state copy ([wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md](wd.spec.2026-04-03-weave-behavior.md:82)).

I’d keep that as the default invariant:

- `workingFilePath`: one current authoring/source location, possibly outside `docs/` under policy.
- `HistoricalState` / `ArtifactManifestation` / `LocatedFile`: mesh-owned immutable snapshot created by weave.
- external raw URLs: fine as `dcat:downloadURL`, provenance, mirrors, or extra `LocatedFile`s, but not the primary mesh-managed historical snapshot unless an explicit policy says so.

If we allow “do not copy historical bytes into the mesh,” I’d make it an explicit future mode, not silent flexibility. Something like a versioning storage policy:

- `SnapshotInMesh` default: copy bytes into historical `LocatedFile`.
- `ExternalPinnedLocatedFile`: historical state points at immutable external bytes, only allowed for tag/SHA/content-addressed URLs, never branch “latest.”
- possibly `MirrorAndReference`: copy into mesh and also retain external `dcat:downloadURL`.

For the adjacent fixture, I’d prove the default first: ontology source lives at `../ontology/foo.ttl`, mesh lives in `docs/`, weave copies the versioned snapshot into `docs/ontology/releases/v0.1.0/ttl/foo.ttl`. That exercises the adjacent-source use case without weakening the historical reproducibility contract.

# User_2026-05-01_2256_31

Should we create a wd.task note for an ontology use case with a sidecar (/docs-based) mesh? I don't think there's something already, but check the [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for me.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2256_45

I’ll check the roadmap and existing task/spec notes for `docs`/sidecar/ontology-adjacent coverage before deciding whether this is genuinely new or already implied by another task.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2256_57

The roadmap does not name an ontology/SHACL sidecar fixture. There is adjacent-path policy work, and even a note saying focused tests may be enough for non-whole-repo meshes, but that is not the same as a concrete ontology publication use case.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2257_18

Yes. I’d create a `wd.task.*` note. The roadmap has adjacent pieces, but not this concrete use case.

What exists:

- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md:10) covers orchestration, import, page-source resolution, renderer refresh, and operational config.
- [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md:12) mentions a `/docs semantic mesh` topology.
- [wd.task.2026.2026-04-11_1723-operational-config-for-runtime-resolution.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-11_1723-operational-config-for-runtime-resolution.md:160) covers non-whole-repo meshes and repo-adjacent paths.
- [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md:24) already uses `ontology` / `ontology/shacl` as motivating target examples.

What’s missing is the actual acceptance/use-case task: a small ontology+SHACL repo where the mesh lives in `docs/`, the working ontology files live adjacent to it, and weave materializes historical snapshots into the mesh.

I’d make the task narrow:

- fixture repo with `docs/` as mesh root
- source files like `ontology/example-ontology.ttl` and `shacl/example-shacl.ttl`
- `workingFilePath "../ontology/example-ontology.ttl"` and `../shacl/...`
- repo access policy allowing those adjacent paths
- payload targets `ontology` and `shacl`
- copy-on-weave historical snapshots under `docs/ontology/releases/v0.1.0/...` and `docs/shacl/releases/v0.1.0/...`
- `owl:versionIRI` points to the published located Turtle file
- no “external historical located file without copy” mode in this task

I’d avoid making the ontology totally fake. Keep it tiny, but valid OWL plus a tiny SHACL graph, so the fixture exercises the real URPX-shaped problem without dragging URPX into Weave tests.

# User_2026-05-01_2259_15

Do we have a better name than "sidecar mesh"?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2259_23

Yes: I’d avoid “sidecar mesh.” It sounds like an implementation attachment, not the important publication topology.

Best candidates:

- **adjacent-source mesh**: best fit for this use case. The key fact is that governed working files live adjacent to the mesh root.
- **docs-rooted mesh**: clear when the important fact is that the mesh root is `docs/`.
- **publication mesh**: good broader category, but too broad by itself.
- **projected mesh**: captures “source tree projected into a public mesh,” but a little abstract.
- **docs publication mesh**: plain and probably good for user-facing docs.

For the task note, I’d use:

`wd.task.2026.2026-MM-DD_HHmm-adjacent-source-docs-mesh.md`

Title:

`Adjacent Source Docs Mesh`

That gives you both essential constraints: source files are adjacent, and the public mesh is rooted in `docs/`.

# User_2026-05-01_2301_00

I actually like sidecar better than any of those. I know there's kubernetes baggage, but a sidecar mesh rides along with the rest of the repo... it isn't the focus of the repo, but it is attached to the repo.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2301_08

That argument is reasonable. “Sidecar mesh” is short, memorable, and it says the mesh is attached to a primary repo rather than being the repo’s main subject.

I’d use **sidecar mesh** as the broad concept, and make the specific fixture a **docs-rooted sidecar mesh**.

Task filename/title:

`wd.task.2026.2026-MM-DD_HHmm-docs-rooted-sidecar-mesh.md`

Title:

`Docs Rooted Sidecar Mesh`

Working definition:

A sidecar mesh is a Semantic Mesh rooted in a publishable subdirectory, such as `docs/`, that rides alongside primary source files in the same repository. The mesh governs public identifiers, generated pages, and historical snapshots, while working payload files may remain outside the mesh root under explicit repo-local path policy.

That gives you the term you like without losing the two concrete technical constraints: `docs/` root and adjacent working payloads.

# User_2026-05-01_2313_33

Great, update the glossary.

# User_2026-05-01_2313_42

Great, update the glossary.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2313_53

I’ll find the glossary note and add the sidecar mesh definition using the docs-rooted wording we just settled, keeping Dendron link style if it references other notes.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2314_02

I don’t see an existing glossary note in `weave/documentation/notes`; there is a `wu.repository-options` note that already defines whole-repo and `/docs` mesh topologies, so I’m going to add “sidecar mesh” there unless a glossary exists under a different name.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2314_07

I’ll update `wu.repository-options.md` as the topology glossary note. It already has the relevant terms and is user-facing, so adding the definition there avoids inventing a parallel glossary file.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2314_18

The glossary-style repository options note is updated. I’m checking the diff now to make sure the wording is narrow and doesn’t accidentally broaden historical `LocatedFile` behavior.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2314_22

Updated [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md:14) with a `Sidecar mesh` definition, including the docs-rooted form and the default copy-on-weave expectation for historical snapshots.

No tests run; docs-only change. There is also an unrelated untracked Kato conversation note in the worktree that I left alone.

# User_2026-05-01_2314_30

I was thinking[sf.glossary.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.glossary.md)

# User_2026-05-01_2314_52

sorry, continue

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2315_10

Got it. I’ll update the framework glossary note you intended, and I’ll clean up the repository-options addition I made if the glossary is the better home for the term.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2315_17

I’m going to move the term into `sf.glossary.md` and remove the duplicate section I added to `wu.repository-options.md`, so the glossary is the source of truth and the repo-options note stays focused on topology choices.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2315_34

The glossary now carries the sidecar mesh definition, and the earlier repository-options duplicate is removed. I’m checking both diffs and repo statuses before I wrap this up.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2315_46

Updated the intended glossary: [sf.glossary.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.glossary.md:51) now defines **Sidecar Mesh** and calls out the docs-rooted form, adjacent `workingFilePath`, repo-local path policy, and default copy-on-weave historical snapshots.

I also removed the duplicate section I had added to `wu.repository-options.md`, so the glossary is the only changed doc for this term. No tests run; docs-only change. Note that this change is in the nested `semantic-flow-framework` repo.

# User_2026-05-01_2321_23

I updated [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md) to at least include the name "Sidecar", as /docs is very specific.

What are the pros and cons of whole-repo vs sidecar for an ontology mesh.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2321_36

For an ontology mesh, I’d treat **whole-repo mesh** as the clean semantic default and **sidecar mesh** as the pragmatic publication default.

**Whole-Repo Mesh**
Pros:
- The mesh root and repo root are the same, so `workingFilePath` can stay simple: `ontology/urpx-ontology.ttl`, `shacl/urpx-shacl.ttl`.
- Historical snapshots live naturally beside the artifact identities: `ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl`.
- Fewer path-policy concerns. You usually do not need `../` access rules.
- Better for a repo whose main purpose is the ontology/public semantic artifact.
- Easier to reason about dereferenceability: every governed artifact is inside the mesh namespace.

Cons:
- Generated history/page surfaces can clutter the source tree.
- If the repo has build scripts, source docs, test fixtures, issue templates, etc., the mesh can feel like it is trying to govern too much.
- Harder to use GitHub Pages from `docs/` without either configuring Pages differently or accepting that the mesh root is not the served root.
- Less appealing if the ontology source and public publication tree need different layout conventions.

**Sidecar Mesh**
Pros:
- Good fit when the repo is primarily an authoring/build repo and `docs/` is the public projection.
- Keeps generated pages and historical snapshots contained under `docs/`.
- Matches GitHub Pages’ common `docs/` publishing mode.
- Lets source files stay in natural authoring locations like `ontology/` and `shacl/`.
- Makes the distinction explicit: working files are source inputs; woven files are public mesh outputs.

Cons:
- Requires repo-local path policy for adjacent sources, e.g. `workingFilePath "../ontology/urpx-ontology.ttl"`.
- More moving parts: mesh root, repo root, source root, and published URL root are distinct concepts.
- Slightly easier to create confusing IRIs if the source layout and public mesh layout diverge.
- The implementation must be disciplined that historical snapshots are copied into the mesh, not left as accidental references to adjacent source files.
- Developers may need more onboarding to understand why the ontology source file and the published historical located file are different files.

For URPX-style ontology publishing, I’d lean **sidecar mesh** if GitHub Pages from `docs/` is the intended publishing path and the repo will contain non-public authoring/build material. I’d lean **whole-repo mesh** only if the repo is deliberately artifact-native: the public mesh layout is the repo layout, and generated histories/pages are first-class source-controlled content rather than a projection.

A good compromise is: source files in `ontology/` and `shacl/`, sidecar mesh in `docs/`, with versioned public snapshots under:

```text
docs/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-ontology.ttl
docs/shacl/releases/v0.2.0/ttl/urpx-shacl.ttl
```

That keeps `owl:versionIRI` clean for publication while preserving source ergonomics.

# User_2026-05-01_2333_14

There's an implicit "best practice" with meshes, that things shouldn't move around too much. In software projects and perhaps most use cases, files will move around based on the needs of the project. I'm thinking that sidecar meshes are the best choice for every repo that's not primarily a mesh. Ontologies qualify. Another issue is that whole-repo meshes, as you hint at, expose everything in the repo at a pages URL. 

Anyhow, I think we can update [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md) to reflect our new thinking here... maybe we should explain why a fixture repo is good for whole-repo meshes and what "reference meshes" and "artifact-native projects" are.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2333_23

I’ll read your current edit in `wu.repository-options.md`, then tighten the guidance around stable mesh layout, sidecar as the default for non-mesh-primary repos, and whole-repo as mainly for fixtures/reference/artifact-native cases.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2333_26

Your current edit already makes sidecar the named alternative. I’m going to expand it into a stronger recommendation: sidecar by default for repos whose primary purpose is not the mesh, and whole-repo only when the repo is intentionally mesh-native.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2333_46

The repo-options note now reflects the stronger default: whole-repo for mesh-native/reference/fixture cases, sidecar for normal project repos including ontologies. I’ll review the diff for tone and line wrapping.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2333_55

Updated [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md:9) to reflect the new guidance:

- whole-repo meshes are now framed as best for fixture repos, reference meshes, and artifact-native projects
- it explains what those terms mean
- it cautions against whole-repo meshes for ordinary software and ontology repos
- sidecar meshes are now recommended as the usual default for repos that are not primarily meshes, including ontology projects
- it calls out stable mesh paths and reduced accidental publication as key reasons

No tests run; docs-only change.

Current worktree also has the earlier glossary update in the nested `semantic-flow-framework` repo and an unrelated untracked Kato conversation note.

# User_2026-05-01_2335_58

I was thinking for the new sidecar repo fixture, creating a D&D-themed ontology based on the Systems Reference Document (https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf). It could start simple enough, maybe with an "AbilityScore" class, an "Alignment" class, etc., although I bet you could go to town rather quickly. What do you think?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2336_27

I like it. It is a better fixture than a fake `foo/bar` ontology because it has real publication pressure without requiring URPX complexity.

The SRD 5.2.1 PDF is explicitly under CC-BY-4.0 and provides an attribution statement, so it is usable for this kind of fixture as long as we include attribution and avoid implying extra Wizards endorsement. Source: https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf

I would not call the public fixture “D&D ontology” unless we are careful. Better names:

- `mesh-5e-srd-sidecar`
- `srd-5e-ontology-sidecar`
- `fantasy-rules-srd-mesh`

For the first slice, keep it deliberately small:

- `docs/` is the sidecar mesh root
- `ontology/srd-ontology.ttl` is the adjacent working ontology file
- `shacl/srd-shacl.ttl` is the adjacent working SHACL file
- `docs/ontology/releases/v0.1.0/ttl/srd-ontology.ttl` is the copied historical snapshot
- `docs/shacl/releases/v0.1.0/ttl/srd-shacl.ttl` is the copied historical snapshot
- include an attribution note in the source and generated/public mesh

For model scope, I’d start with:

- `Ability`
  - individuals: `Strength`, `Dexterity`, `Constitution`, `Intelligence`, `Wisdom`, `Charisma`
- `AbilityScore`
  - a numeric score attached to a creature/character for one `Ability`
- `Alignment`
  - maybe individuals like `LawfulGood`, `Neutral`, etc.
- `Creature`
- `Character`
- maybe one relationship like `hasAbilityScore`

The pushback: don’t start with spells, classes, species, monsters, equipment, and conditions. The SRD table of contents is huge; this could eat the fixture. The fixture’s job is to prove sidecar mesh behavior for ontology+SHACL publication, not to build a complete RPG knowledge graph.

So yes: SRD-inspired, CC-attributed, tiny ontology+SHACL, sidecar mesh rooted at `docs/`. That’s a strong acceptance fixture.

# User_2026-05-01_2342_36

Is [ont.use-cases.alice-bio.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.use-cases.alice-bio.md) up-to-date? It's not a very explanatory title... maybe we should rename to ont.use-cases.reference-data? From [wu.repository-options.md](wu.repository-options.md) I'm not sure whether alice-bio is more of a reference mesh or an artifact-native project.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2342_46

I’ll inspect the Alice Bio use-case note against current ontology vocabulary and the carried fixture shape, then check backlinks before recommending any rename. Since this is in the ontology dependency, I’ll treat edits there carefully and avoid renaming unless the impact is clear.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2344_12

No, [ont.use-cases.alice-bio.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.use-cases.alice-bio.md:9) is not really up-to-date as a description of the current Alice Bio fixture. It reads like an early model sketch: only `alice` and `alice/bio`, older `_history001/_s0001/bio-md` style paths, and no Bob, root page, page-main artifacts, extraction/import behavior, or current fixture ladder.

I would classify Alice Bio as a **reference mesh / fixture repo**, not an artifact-native project. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate Semantic Flow behavior and mint inspectable example identifiers. The Alice Bio content is deliberately small and artificial; it is not the real “native” artifact that the repository exists to maintain.

I would not rename it to `ont.use-cases.reference-data`. That title is too broad and a little misleading, especially because “reference” already has a more specific meaning in `ReferenceCatalog`. Better options:

- `ont.use-cases.alice-bio-reference-mesh`
- `ont.use-cases.reference-mesh`
- keep filename, retitle to **Alice Bio Reference Mesh**, and add a status note saying it is a conceptual fixture sketch, not a complete current inventory

My preference: keep the filename for now, update the title/status/scope, and only rename after deciding whether the note should remain Alice-specific or become a general reference-mesh use case.

# User_2026-05-01_2346_38

I hear ya, but "reference mesh" isn't exactly a use case for "the people". If it weren't a SF demonstration, what would it be. The use case is really "publishing data", specifically personal/biographical data.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2346_55

Agreed. I was mixing two axes:

- **User-facing use case:** publishing personal / biographical linked data.
- **SF project role:** Alice Bio is a reference mesh / fixture implementation of that use case.

So if it were not an SF demo, I’d describe it as something like:

**Biographical Data Publishing**

A person, organization, or project publishes stable identifiers and structured facts for people, bios, profile pages, related entities, and source documents. The mesh provides dereferenceable IDs, human-readable pages, machine-readable RDF, and versioned historical snapshots.

For the note name, I’d lean toward one of these:

- `ont.use-cases.biographical-data-publishing`
- `ont.use-cases.personal-data-publishing`
- `ont.use-cases.profile-data-publishing`

My preference is `ont.use-cases.biographical-data-publishing`. It is specific enough to explain Alice Bio, but broad enough that the use case is not “Alice the fixture”. Then inside the note we can have a section like **Alice Bio Fixture** that says this repository/example is a whole-repo reference mesh used to exercise that publishing use case.

That also keeps `wu.repository-options.md` clean: Alice Bio can be a **reference mesh** as a repository pattern while serving **biographical data publishing** as the human use case.

# User_2026-05-01_2348_45

OK, I renamed. Now make the note useful for what it's entitled. You can link to alice-bio notes as necessary, but it should not provide too much detial about alice-bio.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2348_58

I’ll update the renamed use-case note as a human-facing “biographical data publishing” use case, and keep Alice Bio as an example/reference rather than the body of the note. I’ll first locate which ontology checkout got the rename so I edit the file you have open.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2349_13

The rename is in the sibling ontology checkout at `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology`: old note deleted, new note untracked. I’m going to edit that new note and leave the existing unrelated ontology changes alone unless the note needs a backlink fixed.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2349_40

The rename is actually in the ontology checkout vendored under Weave’s `dependencies/`, not the sibling clean ontology repo. I’m switching to that copy.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2349_51

The current renamed note is still the old Alice-specific designator table under a new title. I’m going to replace that with a use-case description, then keep only a short “Alice Bio fixture” section that points to the fixture/task notes for implementation detail.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2352_39

Updated [ont.use-case.biographical-data-publishing.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.use-case.biographical-data-publishing.md:9) so it now reads as an actual use case: purpose, typical publishers, user needs, Semantic Flow modeling shape, boundaries around people vs artifacts-about-people, repository-shape guidance, and a short Alice Bio fixture pointer.

I kept Alice Bio deliberately small in the note: it now says Alice Bio is a whole-repo reference mesh fixture for this use case, with links to the implementation/task notes, but it no longer carries the old designator table.

Also updated renamed-note references in:
- [ont.summary.core.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.summary.core.md:170)
- [sf.api.examples.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.api.examples.md:15)
- related ontology backlinks/completed notes

No tests run; this was docs-only. I left the unrelated untracked `notes/ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology.md` alone. Suggested commit message: `Reframe Alice Bio as biographical data publishing use case`.

# User_2026-05-01_2353_09

First, should I merge the 25-root-page-customized-woven to main? No harm, right? Makes the default view more interesting. 

Then fill out [ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology.md) if you think that's a good name for our ontology use case.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2353_25

I’ll check the Alice Bio fixture branch state before giving merge advice, then I’ll turn the dereferenceable ontology note into a real use-case note rather than just a placeholder.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2353_36

The ontology use-case file is just frontmatter, so `Dereferenceable Ontology` is a fine note key, but I’m going to title it as “Dereferenceable Ontology Publishing” to make the human use case explicit. I’m also checking whether the Alice Bio branch is a clean fast-forward before saying “no harm.”

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2354_00

The branch check says `origin/main` has zero commits that are not already in `origin/25-root-page-customized-woven`, and `25` has 43 commits on top. That is a fast-forward merge; the main caution is only whether you want `main` to stop being an early minimal fixture state.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2354_42

I’ve filled the note around ontology publication rather than URPX specifics: stable ontology/SHACL artifact IRIs, SF history/state/manifestation/file mapping, OWL `versionIRI` compatibility, and sidecar repo shape. I’ll do one pass now for references and repo status.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2354_59

Yes, merging `25-root-page-customized-woven` to `main` looks fine. I fetched and checked it: `origin/main...origin/25-root-page-customized-woven` is `0 43`, so `main` is strictly behind and the merge should be a fast-forward. The only real caveat is semantic, not Git: `main` will stop being a minimal early fixture and become the rich/current demo surface. That seems desirable now, and Weave tests appear to target explicit fixture branch refs rather than assuming `mesh-alice-bio` `main` is minimal.

I filled out [ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.use-case.dereferenceable-ontology.md:9). I kept the filename but changed the title to **Dereferenceable Ontology Publishing**, which is the better human-facing name.

The note now covers:
- ontology and SHACL as `DigitalArtifact` / `PayloadArtifact` / `RdfDocument` surfaces
- artifact-local release paths like `/ontology/releases/v0.2.0/...` and `/shacl/releases/v0.2.0/...`
- the `owl:versionIRI` compatibility issue, pointing it at versioned bytes while SF uses `HistoricalState` for version identity
- what should stay in the ontology file vs what the mesh should carry
- why sidecar mesh is the practical default for ontology repos
- the fixture direction: tiny real ontology + SHACL, docs-rooted sidecar mesh, copy-on-weave historical snapshots

No tests run; this was docs-only. Suggested commit message: `Document dereferenceable ontology publishing use case`.

# User_2026-05-01_2358_22

what's my merge command? Are we really "done" with the alice-bio stuff for now? Or at least any unfinished work, it's a good time to put aside and pick up later?

I think we'll use mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules as the repo name.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-01_2358_50

Merge command:

```bash
cd /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/mesh-alice-bio
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git merge --ff-only origin/25-root-page-customized-woven
git push origin main
```

That should fast-forward cleanly. I checked `origin/main...origin/25-root-page-customized-woven` and it was `0 43`, meaning `main` has nothing extra and `25` is strictly ahead.

Yes, Alice Bio is at a good stopping point. I would call the fixture ladder “settled enough to put aside”: root page customization is woven, the default page becomes useful, and the roadmap already treats `25-root-page-customized-woven` as settled acceptance coverage. There is still future Weave work around general import behavior, pinned/fallback page-source semantics, and carrying implementation coverage further, but that is follow-on Weave work, not a reason to keep expanding Alice Bio right now.

`mesh-sidecar-fantasy-rules` is a good repo name. It avoids D&D/trademark baggage, says the fixture is a mesh, and makes the sidecar topology the point rather than the domain. Good fit for a tiny SRD-inspired ontology + SHACL + `docs/` mesh fixture.

# User_2026-05-02_0002_34

docs: document publishing-oriented ontology use cases

Reframe the old Alice Bio use-case note as biographical data publishing,
so the note describes the human-facing use case rather than the fixture
implementation details. Position Alice Bio as a small whole-repo reference
mesh fixture for that use case, with the detailed fixture ladder left to
the task and conformance notes.

Add a dereferenceable ontology publishing use case covering ontology and
SHACL artifacts, artifact-local release paths, Semantic Flow
DigitalArtifact/ArtifactHistory/HistoricalState modeling, and the practical

# User_2026-05-02_0006_15

Can you make a note somewhere, maybe [sf.todo.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.todo.md) that "mesh-content" should probably live inside "_mesh"?

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0006_25

I’ll add this to the framework todo note and keep it as a modeling/layout follow-up, not a settled decision.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0006_31

`sf.todo.md` has empty “Immediately” and a small “Eventually” list. Since this is still a “probably” layout question, I’m putting it under “Eventually” as an explicit decision item with the implications called out.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0006_46

Added it to [sf.todo.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/notes/sf.todo.md:13) under **Eventually**.

I phrased it as a decision item: `mesh-content/` probably belongs under `_mesh/`, with possible shapes like `_mesh/content/` or `_mesh/_content/`, and called out the things to check before changing convention: page-source examples, `targetMeshPath`, root-page fixtures, and sidecar meshes.

No tests run; docs-only.

# User_2026-05-02_0013_35

OK, now fill out [wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md](wd.task.2026.2026-05-02-fantasy-rules-sidecar.md) . We might have several goals here in addition to simply generating a sidecar. i.e., we can use this opportunity to improve templating, look-and-feel, new features, better resource pages. I wouldn't mind trying to include the javascript in resource pages that hacks of the trailing slash to make the in-browser URL look like the IRI.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0013_52

I’ll turn this into a concrete task note with the sidecar fixture as the carrier, plus explicit stretch goals for templates, resource-page quality, and the trailing-slash URL polish. I’m going to check the current note and nearby task-note style first so the shape matches the repo.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0014_02

The task note is only a skeleton. I’ll anchor it to the dereferenceable ontology use case and repository-options guidance, then make the “sidecar fantasy rules” repo a fixture plus a design-improvement carrier.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0014_40

I’m going to make the note action-oriented: first prove the sidecar ontology/SHACL fixture, then use that fixture to drive templating and page-quality improvements without letting those stretch goals block the core topology proof.

# User_2026-05-02_0015_38

OH, and including the raw RDF for RdfDocument ResourcePages.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0015_45

I’ll fold that into the task as a resource-page requirement: RDF-document pages should expose the raw RDF inline or in a clearly accessible raw view, not only link to the bytes.

# gpt-5.5_2026-05-02_0016_12

Updated the task note and added raw RDF as an explicit resource-page requirement.

The note now says `RdfDocument` pages should include inspectable raw RDF when local bytes are available, covering current ontology/SHACL pages plus manifestation/located-file pages. It also adds contract and testing items so this does not become just a visual flourish.

No tests run; docs-only.
