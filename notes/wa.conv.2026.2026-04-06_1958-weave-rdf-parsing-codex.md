weave rdf parsing

I think we're ready to tackle [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] 

Is this still the right approach? Any open issues?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1953_03

I’m reviewing the task note against the current repo state and the standing guidance first. I’ll read the product vision, `wd.general-guidance`, the RDF parsing task note, and then inspect the current parsing-related code to check whether the approach still fits and what is still unresolved.

I have the task note and repo guidance loaded. Next I’m checking the current source to see whether that inventory is still accurate and whether the sequencing still matches what the code is actually doing now.

The note’s main picture still matches the code, but the inventory is already a bit stale. I found additional live runtime `meshBase` regex readers outside the four called out there, so I’m checking those and the current weave/extract helpers before I answer on sequencing.

I’ve confirmed the main debt categories, and there’s one important correction: the note is not a full inventory of current RDF text-parsing debt any more. I’m checking whether there’s already a shared RDF helper seam elsewhere in the repo that this task should build around instead of inventing a second parsing path.

I found one more thing that changes the recommendation: there is already RDF-aware logic in `core/payload/update.ts`, so a new parsing helper layer does not need to start from zero. I’m reading that seam now because it looks like the natural place to centralize quad-based inventory lookups instead of letting `weave`, `extract`, and `payload.update` each invent their own parser helpers.

I have enough to answer substantively. I’m pulling exact code references now so I can call out the gaps cleanly instead of hand-waving about “some other files”.

Yes, broadly. The sequencing in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing#L70]] is still the right one: fix live runtime readers first, then tighten `core/weave`, and leave the big graph-mutation rewrites for later. That still matches the code in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L158), [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts#L188), [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts#L165), and [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts#L218).

The main issue is that the note is underscoped now, so I would update it before implementation.

- The inventory is incomplete. The note says “four runtime loaders” still regex `meshBase`, but there are at least two more live runtime readers in [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts#L315) and [add_reference.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts#L201). `runtime/payload/update` also still block-parses Knop inventory text in [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts#L354).
- I would not treat `core/weave` as the only existing RDF-aware seam. `core/payload/update` already has a better “required triples over parsed quads” pattern in [update.ts](../../src/core/payload/update.ts#L227), and it already has an equivalent-format test in [update_test.ts](../../src/core/payload/update_test.ts#L53). That should inform the shared helper design.
- Step 2 should probably widen from just `extract` and `weave` to `payload.update` too. Otherwise we will centralize parsed inventory discovery for two runtime paths and leave a third sibling on the old block-parser pattern.
- Step 3 needs a strict boundary before coding: convert `core/weave` from substring checks to parsed-quad “required fact” checks, not to a generic validator. Right now both slice detection and shape assertions are still formatting-coupled in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L279) and [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L844). If that target is fuzzy, this step will balloon.
- There is one more deferred mutation bucket not called out in the note: `core/knop/add_reference` still does line-oriented KnopInventory surgery in [add_reference.ts](../../src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L205). I would group that with the later `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate` graph-mutation rewrite rather than leaving it orphaned.

So: yes, ready to tackle, but I’d amend the note first to cover all six runtime `meshBase` readers, pull `payload.update` into the shared-runtime-reader phase, and explicitly define step 3 as “graph-aware carried-slice assertions” rather than “generic RDF validation.” If you want, I can update the task note and then start the first code slice from there.

# User_2026-04-06_1958_27

Please update and then let me review before starting implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1958_42

I’m updating the task note now to fix the stale inventory and narrow the intended implementation boundary. The changes will fold in `runtime/payload.update`, `runtime/knop/add_reference`, the existing quad-based seam in `core/payload.update`, and the deferred `core/knop/add_reference` mutation work, without starting code implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1959_18

The note is patched. I’m doing one pass over the result to make sure the scope changes read cleanly and that I didn’t accidentally blur the “shared runtime cleanup first, graph rewrites later” boundary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_1959_25

I updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md).

The main changes are:

- expanded the stale `meshBase` inventory from four to six runtime readers by adding `runtime/payload.update` and `runtime/knop/add_reference`
- widened the shared runtime-reader phase to include `payload.update`, not just `extract` and `weave`
- made the existing RDF-aware seams explicit in both `core/weave` and `core/payload.update`
- tightened the boundary for step 3 so it stays “carried-slice required-fact checks” rather than drifting into generic validation
- added `core/knop/add_reference` to the deferred graph-mutation rewrite bucket

I did not start implementation. Review the note and tell me what you want changed before I touch code.

# User_2026-04-06_2109_56

claude feedback:

Priority 1 implementation plan checkbox should say loadMeshState not loadCurrentMeshState for extract.ts.
The existing payloadMentionsTarget n3 usage in extract.ts is worth calling out in the "partial progress" section of Priority 3 or Priority 2, since it's an existing RDF-aware seam in the runtime layer (not just core).

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2110_10

I’m applying the two note fixes now: correcting the `extract.ts` function name in the Priority 1 inventory, and adding the existing runtime `payloadMentionsTarget` quad-parsing seam so the note reflects that runtime progress more accurately.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2110_15

Updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md).

I corrected the `extract.ts` Priority 1 function name to `loadMeshState` and added `runtime/extract`’s existing `payloadMentionsTarget` `n3` seam under Priority 2 partial progress so the note now reflects the runtime-side RDF-aware work already in place.

No implementation started.

# User_2026-04-06_2127_41

There's still no daemon, but eventually we will want to support reading some or all of a mesh's RDF into memory. Maybe before the "markdown payload publishing" slice, because it might be helpful for keeping track of job status/rollback/mesh awareness. Maybe I'm way off?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2127_52

I’m checking the current daemon scaffold and any notes that already constrain job state or rollback assumptions. Then I’ll answer whether “load mesh RDF into memory” is a good pre-publishing step or a distraction.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2127_58

I’ve confirmed the daemon is still just a stub, so the answer is architectural rather than “what the code already expects.” I’m pulling the decision-log lines that matter here, because the right answer depends on whether we mean per-operation graph loading, a daemon-wide mesh cache, or something stronger like transactional state.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2128_16

You’re not way off, but I would split that idea in two.

A daemon-side, long-lived in-memory mesh model is not something I’d do before Markdown publishing. The daemon is still a stub at [mod.ts](../../src/daemon/mod.ts), and the current architecture explicitly keeps semantic logic in shared `core`/`runtime` below the daemon in [wd.decision-log.md](wd.decision-log.md). If we jump straight to a resident mesh cache, we take on invalidation, locking, coherence, and partial-failure semantics before we even have real daemon job flow.

What I do think is worth doing before Markdown publishing is a smaller thing: operation-scoped RDF read models. That is very close to the current RDF-parsing cleanup task. A publishing slice will likely want to read current mesh facts, current Knop facts, payload facts, and link relationships in memory for one operation. That helps with mesh awareness. It does not require a daemon-global graph cache.

I’d be more explicit about the three concerns:

- Job status: this should not depend on loading mesh RDF into memory. It wants a durable job store and explicit status records. The project already wants job-centric operations in [wd.decision-log.md](wd.decision-log.md), but that is separate from mesh graph loading.
- Rollback: this is currently filesystem staging plus rename/backup logic in [add_reference.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts) and [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts). In-memory RDF does not solve rollback.
- Mesh awareness: yes, this is where parsed in-memory graph views help, especially for publishing and later daemon handlers.

So my recommendation is:

1. Finish the RDF read-path cleanup as operation-local parsed helpers and small read models.
2. Use that same seam for Markdown publishing.
3. Defer any daemon-wide mesh cache or resident graph index until there is a real daemon job loop and a measured need.

If you want, I can turn that into one short paragraph in the RDF parsing note or the Markdown publishing note so the sequencing is recorded.

# User_2026-04-06_2130_27

maybe just make a note in [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) 

You want to proceed with implementation in this chat?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2130_33

I’m opening [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) to match its existing structure, then I’ll add a short follow-up note about operation-scoped in-memory RDF read models and deferring any daemon-wide mesh cache.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2130_39

`wd.todo.md` is effectively blank, so I’m adding one narrow backlog item rather than inventing a whole todo structure. The note will point at operation-scoped parsed RDF read models as a possible pre-publishing seam and explicitly defer any daemon-wide mesh cache until daemon job flow is real.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2130_49

Added the backlog note to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md).

Yes, I can proceed with implementation in this chat. The right first slice is still narrow: Priority 1 from [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md), meaning one shared RDF-aware `meshBase` reader, replace the six runtime regex call sites, and add tests. I would not jump straight to daemon-oriented caching work.

# User_2026-04-06_2131_22

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2131_32

I’m starting the first implementation slice from the RDF parsing task: shared runtime `meshBase` parsing only. I’ll inspect the six call sites and current test coverage, then wire in one helper, add focused tests, and run the matching test/lint commands before stopping.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2131_53

I’ve got the six readers and the current test surface. Next I’m reading the exact runtime functions so I can put the helper in the right place and avoid introducing another ad hoc parsing path or awkward export boundary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2132_23

I’ve narrowed the seam. I’m going to add a shared mesh-metadata helper under `runtime/mesh`, use the pure parse helper from the five multi-file readers, use the file-loading wrapper for `knop.add_reference`, and then add focused tests around equivalent Turtle formatting and the affected runtimes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2133_28

I’m editing the runtime now. First pass is the shared mesh-metadata helper plus replacing the regex extraction in the runtime call sites. After that I’ll add focused parser tests and a small equivalent-metadata integration test for each affected operation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2134_07

The shared helper is in and the six regex readers are replaced. I’m adding the focused tests now: one parser unit test file and one “equivalent mesh metadata” runtime success test per affected operation so this slice is locked before I run the suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2134_40

The code and tests are in. I’m formatting and running the targeted test set first so I can catch any type or import mistakes before I run lint over the whole repo.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2134_45

The targeted test run is still executing. I’m polling for the result; if anything fails, I’ll fix it before I touch the broader lint step.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2134_47

The first test run failed on a small typing issue in the new helper, not on behavior. I’m tightening the `n3` types now and rerunning the same targeted suite before moving on.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2135_04

The code-level test run hit the repo’s existing `n3` permission requirement, not a regression in the new logic. I’m checking the project test task and then rerunning the same targeted tests with the normal env permission the repo already expects.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2135_10

The remaining failures are just from me running the tests too narrowly on permissions. I’m rerunning the same targeted suite with the repo’s normal test permissions now; after that I’ll run lint.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2135_27

The targeted tests are green so far, including the new equivalent-metadata runtime cases. I’m waiting for the tail of the run, then I’ll do `deno task lint` as required for the change set.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2135_36

The behavior slice is passing. I’m running repo-wide lint and type-check now because this touched shared runtime structure, not just one isolated function.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2135_47

Validation is clean: targeted tests passed, `deno task lint` passed, and `deno task check` passed. I’m doing one last diff/status pass so I can summarize the exact slice cleanly and give you a concrete commit message.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2136_11

**Implemented**
Priority 1 of the RDF parsing task is now in code.

# User_2026-04-06_2140_31

update the task ticket please. Any post-change considerations?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2140_45

I’m updating the RDF parsing task note to reflect the completed Priority 1 slice and the new validation coverage, then I’ll summarize the main post-change considerations so the next step is clear rather than implicit.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2141_25

I’m patching the task note now to record the completed Priority 1 slice, the new shared helper, and the validation that landed with it. After that I’ll call out the couple of post-change considerations that are actually worth tracking.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2141_52

The ticket is patched. I’m giving the updated sections one quick pass so I can summarize the new state cleanly and flag only the real follow-up considerations, not speculative noise.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2142_01

Updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md). It now records Priority 1 as complete, points at the shared helper in [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts), notes the equivalent-metadata coverage, and makes Priority 2 the clear next step.

Post-change considerations:

- The new helper currently accepts any document with exactly one `sflo:meshBase` `xsd:anyURI` literal. That is fine for the carried mesh metadata shape, but if `_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl` grows, we may want to tighten it to require the expected subject as well.
- The real next slice is still runtime inventory discovery in `extract`, `weave`, and `payload.update`. That is where the remaining formatting fragility lives.
- I would keep this as operation-scoped read logic for now. This change improves daemon reuse later, but it is not yet an argument for a daemon-wide in-memory mesh cache.

# User_2026-04-06_2145_00

"the expected subject as well."?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2145_15

In [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts#L31), the helper currently accepts any quad in the file whose predicate is `sflo:meshBase` and whose object is an `xsd:anyURI` literal.

I meant we could tighten that later to require that the `sflo:meshBase` triple is attached to the mesh resource we actually expect, probably `<_mesh>`, not just any subject in `_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl`.

Why that matters:

- current behavior is fine for the carried metadata shape
- but if that file later contains another resource with its own `sflo:meshBase`, the helper could reject as ambiguous or accept the wrong one

So “expected subject” means something like:

- subject must be `<_mesh>` or its base-resolved IRI
- optionally also require that subject to be typed `sflo:SemanticMesh`

I did not enforce that yet because this slice was meant to replace regex fragility, not silently broaden into fuller metadata shape validation.

# User_2026-04-06_2146_24

ok, add that to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) and then proceed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2148_33

I’m moving to Priority 2 now: shared parsed inventory helpers for `extract`, `weave`, and `payload.update`. I’m going to centralize the Knop/payload/reference lookups under `runtime/mesh`, refactor the three runtime readers to use them, and cover the equivalent-format cases with helper tests before rerunning the relevant suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2149_20

I found the main constraint for Priority 2: end-to-end “equivalent inventory formatting” tests are blocked in places by the still-string-based `core/weave` and mutation seams. So I’m putting the format-flexibility proof mostly into shared helper unit tests while keeping the existing runtime integration suite as the behavior safety net.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2151_02

The first refactor patch failed on context drift in `payload.update.ts`, so I’m reloading the exact current sections and then I’ll apply the changes in smaller patches. That’s just patch hygiene, not a design change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2151_52

I’m proceeding with the next RDF parsing slice. First I’m checking the current runtime inventory readers and the backlog note so I can refactor the shared read path without drifting into mutation work.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2152_04

The backlog note for operation-scoped read models is already there. I’m also adding the narrower follow-up about tightening mesh metadata subject matching, then I’ll refactor the shared inventory readers in `extract`, `weave`, and `payload.update`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2152_13

I have the current runtime seams in view. Next I’m pulling the existing parser-based inventory code and the task note’s Priority 2 wording so the new helper API matches the intended boundary instead of inventing a broader model.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2153_09

I’ve confirmed the remaining formatter-coupled readers are exactly the Priority 2 ones the note calls out. I’m adding the follow-up TODO entry now, then I’m landing a small shared inventory helper and wiring the three runtime paths onto it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2154_58

I’ve got the helper surface pinned down: one parsed inventory reader for Knop discovery, one for payload artifact state, one for ReferenceCatalog state, and one for reference-target lookup. I’m writing those first so the runtime call sites only change at the edges.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2156_39

The helper and runtime call-site edits are in. I’m formatting and then running the targeted test slice first so I can catch any API or message drift before I touch the task note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2156_47

The refactor compiles. I’m waiting on the targeted test run now; after that I’ll do the broader lint/check pass and then update the task note with what actually landed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2157_10

The shared runtime inventory reader slice passed the targeted tests and the repo-wide `lint`/`check` passes. I’m updating the task note now so it reflects the actual boundary that landed: shared read-path parsing is done, but `core/weave` and the mutation seams are still the next real debt.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2157_18

The task note had gone stale in a few places after the refactor, not just the checklist. I’m tightening the summary and priority descriptions so it no longer claims the three runtime paths still use the block parsers we just removed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2158_09

Updated the task note and proceeded with Priority 2.

The backlog note is now in [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md), including the narrower follow-up about tightening `meshBase` to the expected mesh subject later. The task note at [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) now marks Priority 2 complete and shifts the next step to `core/weave` shape assertions.

The code change is a shared parsed inventory seam in [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts) with unit coverage in [inventory_test.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory_test.ts). `extract`, `weave`, and `payload.update` now use that helper instead of their local Knop/payload/reference block parsers in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts), [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts). The old `matchAll` and `split("\n\n")` inventory readers are gone from those three runtime files.

Verification passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/runtime/mesh/metadata_test.ts src/runtime/mesh/inventory_test.ts tests/integration/extract_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

Post-change considerations:
- The next real debt is still `core/weave`; runtime discovery is now graph-aware, but end-to-end acceptance of differently formatted Knop inventories is still limited by carried shape checks in core.
- The new helper is intentionally narrow. It resolves required facts for current slices; it is not a generic validator or graph rewrite layer.
- The deferred `meshBase` subject-tightening is only noted in backlog for now; [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts) still accepts the one valid `sflo:meshBase` literal regardless of subject.

Commit message suggestion:
`runtime: share RDF-aware inventory discovery across carried readers`

- add shared parsed inventory helpers for knop, payload, reference catalog, and extracted target discovery
- replace duplicated text-based inventory readers in extract, weave, and payload.update
- add unit coverage for semantically equivalent inventory turtle and keep carried integration tests green

# User_2026-04-06_2158_09

coderabbit feedback:

In `@src/runtime/extract/extract.ts`:
- Around line 214-217: Wrap calls to resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle inside
loadMeshState with a try-catch that catches any Error and rethrows an
ExtractRuntimeError carrying the original error message and/or error as cause;
specifically, in loadMeshState, replace the direct return of meshBase:
resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle(meshMetadataTurtle) with logic that calls
resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle(meshMetadataTurtle) inside try { ... } and on
catch (err) throw new ExtractRuntimeError('Could not resolve mesh base from
metadata', err) (or include err.message), ensuring the module preserves its
ExtractRuntimeError contract.

In `@src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts`:
- Around line 25-44: Replace the plain thrown Error instances in metadata
resolution with the typed MeshMetadataResolutionError: catch parse failures of
meshMetadataTurtle (the try around new Parser().parse) and throw new
MeshMetadataResolutionError(MESH_BASE_ERROR_MESSAGE, { cause: err }) (or
equivalent constructor) instead of throw new Error(...), and likewise replace
the size-check error (where meshBaseValues.size !== 1) with throwing
MeshMetadataResolutionError(MESH_BASE_ERROR_MESSAGE). Update callers (notably
the extract flow that calls metadata resolution) to map/propagate
MeshMetadataResolutionError into the runtime-specific error path so extract
returns an ExtractRuntimeError-wrapped failure.

Nitpick comments:
In `@tests/support/mesh_metadata.ts`:
- Around line 10-11: The test currently calls Deno.writeTextFile for the path
produced by join(workspaceRoot, "_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl") without ensuring the
parent directory exists; update the setup in tests/support/mesh_metadata.ts to
create the "_mesh/_meta" directory first (e.g., call
Deno.mkdir(join(workspaceRoot, "_mesh", "_meta"), { recursive: true }) or an
equivalent ensureDir helper) before invoking Deno.writeTextFile so the write
cannot fail due to a missing directory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2158_22

I’m addressing the review feedback directly. First I’m checking the current metadata helper and each runtime caller so I can tighten the error typing without changing the external runtime error contracts.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2158_32

The helper still throws plain `Error`, and `extract` is the one CodeRabbit called out explicitly. I’m tightening the metadata helper first, then I’ll wrap the runtime-side metadata resolution where it preserves the module-specific error type instead of leaking a helper type upward.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2159_04

The cleanest fix is a typed metadata-resolution error plus a runtime-specific wrap at the metadata boundary. I’m making that explicit and adding a test for the extract-side contract so this doesn’t regress later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2159_11

I’m making the wrap consistent across the runtime callers that read mesh metadata, not just `extract`. The underlying helper will throw a typed resolution error, and each runtime boundary will translate that into its own runtime error type before the main operation logic sees it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2200_01

I’ve applied the error typing and runtime wrapping. I’m adding one extract integration test that deliberately breaks mesh metadata, so we verify the runtime still fails with `ExtractRuntimeError` instead of leaking the helper-level type.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2200_11

The contract test is in. I’m formatting and then running the metadata-focused integration slice across all affected runtime commands, since I touched every metadata caller for consistency rather than only `extract`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2200_22

The metadata-focused test slice is running. I also checked the worktree so I don’t accidentally lose the earlier Priority 2 changes; the only relevant dirt is the runtime/doc work we’ve already been carrying in this thread.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2200_38

The feedback fixes are green under tests and lint. I’m just waiting for `deno task check` to finish, then I’ll summarize exactly what changed and what I think about the review itself.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2200_49

The feedback was directionally right. The plain `Error` throws in [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts) were too weak, and the test helper in [mesh_metadata.ts](../../tests/support/mesh_metadata.ts) should not assume `_mesh/_meta` already exists.

I applied it and went slightly broader for consistency. [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts) now throws `MeshMetadataResolutionError`, [metadata_test.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata_test.ts) asserts that type, and the runtime metadata boundaries in [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts), [create.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/create.ts), [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts), [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts), and [add_reference.ts](../../src/runtime/knop/add_reference.ts) now translate metadata-resolution failures back into their module-specific runtime errors. I also added an extract regression test in [extract_test.ts](../../tests/integration/extract_test.ts) to ensure invalid mesh metadata still comes back as `ExtractRuntimeError`.

Verification passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/runtime/mesh/metadata_test.ts tests/integration/knop_create_test.ts tests/integration/integrate_test.ts tests/integration/extract_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/integration/payload_update_test.ts tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

# User_2026-04-06_2202_30

OK, what's next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2202_40

I’m checking the current `core/weave` seam so I can answer with the next concrete slice rather than a generic “Priority 3” label.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2202_55

Next is still Priority 3: move `core/weave` from string-fragment shape checks to parsed-fact checks.

Concretely, I’d do it in this order:

1. Convert slice detection in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L279).
2. Convert the carried shape assertions that still rely on `includes()` in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L844).
3. Reuse the existing quad seam near [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2636) instead of inventing another parser layer.

I would not jump to the `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` mesh-inventory rewrites yet in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2102), and I would not jump to daemon/cache work. The runtime readers are now the less fragile part; `core/weave` is the remaining blocker if we want the carried slices to tolerate equivalent Turtle formatting before Markdown publishing.

If you want, I can start that next slice now: first `detectPendingWeaveSlice`, then the `assertCurrentMeshInventoryShapeFor*` family, with focused tests around semantically equivalent KnopInventory and MeshInventory Turtle.

# User_2026-04-06_2202_55

did you update the implementation plan?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2203_00

Yes. [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) now marks both completed items as done:

- shared `meshBase` runtime reader
- shared parsed inventory helpers for `extract`, `weave`, and `payload.update`

The remaining unchecked next item is the `core/weave` graph-aware carried-slice check slice.

# User_2026-04-06_2211_30

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2211_41

I’m proceeding with the `core/weave` slice now. First I’m reading the current detection/assertion helpers and the existing tests so I can replace the formatting-coupled checks with parsed-fact checks without broadening behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2211_45

I’ve confirmed the string debt is concentrated in `detectPendingWeaveSlice` and the carried assertion helpers, not the later exact rewrite seam. I’m reading the planner tests next so I can add semantic-equivalence coverage at the right layer instead of only relying on runtime integration tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2212_00

I’ve got the planner tests open. The right implementation boundary is clear now: convert only the inventory/metadata Turtle assertions, not the later exact rewrite seam and not the non-RDF path checks. I’m checking for any additional `includes()`-based shape helpers below the section we already inspected so I don’t leave a half-converted planner.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2214_53

I have the boundary pinned down. I’m editing `core/weave` now: thread `meshBase` into slice detection/assertion, replace the `includes()` checks with parsed RDF fact checks, and leave the later `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` mutation seam alone.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2216_58

The file drifted enough that the bulk patch didn’t apply cleanly. I’m switching to smaller patches against the exact current call sites so I don’t risk stomping unrelated logic in `core/weave`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2220_10

The planner-side `includes()` checks are now down to the intentionally deferred seams: the path-string check on `latestHistoricalStatePath` and the `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` rewrite seam. I’m adding planner tests now for equivalent Turtle so this slice proves real value instead of only refactoring internals.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2220_38

I’m using tests that deliberately change serialization but not meaning, instead of writing brand-new fixtures. That keeps the coverage focused on the exact fragility we’re removing: type-line formatting, predicate order, and resource-page triple formatting.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2221_07

The core tests now cover equivalent serialization in three places: first payload planning, first reference-catalog planning, and second-payload slice detection. I’m formatting and running the focused `core/weave` test slice first, because that’s where any signature drift will show up immediately.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2221_15

The focused test runs are building now. If something fails here it will almost certainly be a parser-fact mismatch or an over-tightened carried-shape check, which is exactly what I want to catch before broader validation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2221_24

The runtime integration layer is green. The core test failure was just the Deno permission mismatch from the repo’s test stack, not a planner regression, so I’m rerunning the core suite with the same env permission the repo already needs elsewhere.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2221_44

I found one real regression: the old “non-alice designator” test was accidentally changing the Turtle `@base` from `mesh-alice-bio` to `mesh-carol-bio` with a blanket `replaceAll("alice", "carol")`. The old string-matching code ignored that inconsistency; the new RDF-aware code correctly notices it. I’m tightening that test instead of teaching the planner to accept a contradictory mesh base.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2222_13

I tightened the non-alice test to stop mutating `@base`. I’m rerunning the core planner suite with the permissions it actually needs for fixture lookup, which should tell us whether the remaining logic change is sound or if one of the carried assertions is still too strict.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2222_52

The core planner suite is green now, including the equivalent-Turtle cases and the existing extracted/weird-case coverage. I’m doing the normal repo validation next, then I’ll update the RDF task note to mark the `core/weave` slice done if the broader checks stay clean.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2222_56

Lint found one harmless leftover constant from the helper refactor. I’m removing that and then rerunning lint; the typecheck was otherwise progressing cleanly through the repo.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2223_16

The code slice is complete and validated. I’m updating the task note now so it reflects the new reality: runtime readers and `core/weave` carried-shape assertions are both graph-aware, while the remaining debt is the narrower rewrite/block-parser seam rather than the general planner gating.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2223_51

The task note is updated. I’m doing one last quick status pass so I can close with the real next step and not a stale checklist item.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2224_05

Implemented Priority 3 and updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md). The main code is in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) and [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts): `detectPendingWeaveSlice` and the carried `core/weave` shape assertions now parse RDF and check required/forbidden facts instead of relying on exact Turtle fragments. I also threaded the new `meshBase` argument through [runtime/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts).

I added planner tests for semantically equivalent Turtle in first-payload planning, first-reference-catalog planning, and second-payload slice detection. One existing non-alice planner test had to be tightened because it was accidentally changing `@base`; the old string-matching code ignored that inconsistency, while the new RDF-aware code correctly does not.

Validation passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

What’s next is no longer `core/weave` gating. The remaining near-term debt before broader graph mutation is the narrower string-coupled seam: [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) still has `extractCurrentReferenceCatalogLinks`, the `latestHistoricalStatePath.includes(...)` path check, and the `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` extracted-weave rewrite ladder, while [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts) still has the block-oriented extract surgery.

Commit message suggestion: `core: make weave slice gating RDF-aware`

# User_2026-04-06_2225_21

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2225_35

I’m proceeding with the next narrow RDF slice: the remaining carried extract/extracted-weave read logic, not the big graph-mutation rewrite. First I’m checking the current `core/weave` ReferenceCatalog reader and the `core/extract` block parser so I can pick the next smallest piece that removes real formatting fragility.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2225_51

I found the clean next cut: `core/weave` still block-parses current ReferenceCatalog Turtle even though the rest of the planner gate is now RDF-aware. I’m converting that reader next and leaving the exact-rewrite seam alone.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2226_53

Proceeding with the next narrow RDF parsing slice: `core/weave` reference catalog link discovery. I’m refreshing the repo guidance and then I’ll replace the remaining block parser in `core/weave` with parsed-quad logic and add focused tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2226_59

I’ve refreshed the repo guidance and confirmed the remaining `core/weave` string-coupled seam is the current ReferenceCatalog link reader. Next I’m patching that function to parse quads and then I’ll add equivalent-Turtle planner coverage around the reference-catalog paths.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2227_05

The remaining `core/weave` parser is self-contained enough to swap without widening the scope. I’m checking the existing quad helpers and then I’ll patch both call sites and the tests in one edit so the error semantics stay stable.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2227_29

I’ve isolated the exact behavior to preserve: same `WeaveInputError` messages, but the reader should now tolerate reordered predicates and `rdf:type` in current ReferenceCatalog files. I’m patching both the parser and tests together so we don’t leave an unproven seam behind.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2227_35

I’m editing `core/weave` now. The change is narrow: add RDF-aware ReferenceCatalog link extraction, thread `meshBase` through the two callers, drop the last block parser in that file, and extend tests to cover equivalent current ReferenceCatalog Turtle including pinned historical-state links.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2228_16

The parser change is in place. I’m adding tests that would have failed under the old implementation: current ReferenceCatalog Turtle with `rdf:type` and reordered link predicates, including the extracted case where `referenceTargetState` is present.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2228_38

The `core/weave` code is patched and the new tests are in. I’m running the focused `weave` test set first; if that passes, I’ll run `lint` and `check`, then I’ll update the task note to reflect that this remaining `core/weave` block parser is gone.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2228_49

The focused weave suite is green. I’m running `lint` and `check` now, and I’ll also do a quick grep to confirm `core/weave` no longer contains the old ReferenceCatalog block parser pattern.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2228_59

The code is green. I’m updating the task note now so it reflects the smaller follow-on state accurately: the `core/weave` ReferenceCatalog reader is no longer part of the debt inventory, and the remaining items are the extract-specific rewrites plus the `replaceExactOrThrow` ladder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2229_32

The task note is updated. I’m doing one quick status/diff pass so I can call out the exact remaining debt cleanly instead of hand-waving over it in the wrap-up.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2229_48

Implemented the next RDF parsing slice and updated the task note.

`core/weave` no longer block-parses current ReferenceCatalog Turtle. [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L1505) now parses quads, resolves `ReferenceLink` facts by subject, and preserves the existing `WeaveInputError` contract; the two planner call sites now pass `meshBase` into that reader at [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L604) and [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L829). I added equivalent-Turtle coverage for both the first ReferenceCatalog slice and the extracted Bob slice in [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L443) and [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L784). The task note now reflects that this parser is gone and that the remaining near-term debt is the `core/extract` surgery plus the extracted-weave `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` ladder in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md#L35).

Validation passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

Post-change, the practical next slice is narrow and clear: `src/core/extract/extract.ts` block/regex surgery, then the extracted-weave rewrite ladder in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2470). I would not jump yet to the larger graph-mutation rewrites in `core/knop/create`, `core/integrate`, or `core/knop/add_reference`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2230_44

Proceeding with the remaining extract-side RDF parsing debt. I’m inspecting `core/extract` and its tests first so I can choose the smallest defensible cut rather than mixing the extract surgery with the extracted-weave rewrite ladder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2231_00

I’ve confirmed the remaining extract debt is isolated to three helpers in `core/extract`. Before editing, I’m checking the current `knop create` and `knop add_reference` outputs plus the extracted fixture shape, because the safest next cut is to stop parsing those files as blocks while still preserving the settled extract output shape.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2231_47

The main technical decision here is whether to rewrite all three helpers now or only the ones that can be made parser-aware without destabilizing the settled extract fixture. I’m checking the higher-level extract tests before I choose, because `reorderMeshInventoryLocatedFiles` sits on a much larger `_mesh/_inventory` document and I don’t want to hide a broader serialization change inside this slice.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2232_37

I’m editing `core/extract` now. The cut is narrower than a full parser refactor: stop mutating the created KnopInventory and ReferenceCatalog Turtle from sibling planner outputs, render those files directly from known extract facts instead, and leave the `_mesh/_inventory` block reorder as the one remaining documented narrow seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2232_55

The extract planner no longer edits the created KnopInventory or ReferenceCatalog by string surgery. I’m checking the patch shape now, then I’ll clean up the leftover function boundary and adjust the tests/task note to match the new narrower residual seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2232_58

The planner patch is structurally right; there’s just a leftover dead function stub from the old KnopInventory normalizer. I’m cleaning that up and tightening the extract test comment so it reflects the new state of the seam accurately.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2233_10

The extract planner now renders the created KnopInventory and ReferenceCatalog directly from known extract facts; only the mesh-inventory block reorder remains as a documented narrow text seam. I’m running the focused extract tests now, then `lint` and `check`, and I’ll update the task note if the suite is clean.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2233_20

The extract-specific tests are green and the settled Bob fixture still matches exactly. I’m running `lint` and `check` now, then I’ll narrow the task note so it no longer lists the two extract helpers we just removed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2233_26

The code is clean. I’m updating the task note to reflect the smaller residual debt precisely: `core/extract` no longer has three string-surgery helpers, just the located-file reorder, and the next slice is now that plus the extracted-weave `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` ladder.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2233_48

The note is updated and consistent with the code. I’m doing one final status pass so I can call out exactly what landed and what still remains before we move to the last extract/weave seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2234_02

Implemented the next extract-side cleanup and updated the task note.

[extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L99) now renders the created extract KnopInventory and ReferenceCatalog directly from known extract facts instead of mutating sibling planner outputs, with the canonical renderers at [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L263) and [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L295). The only remaining documented extract text seam is [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L317), which still reorders the new mesh-inventory `LocatedFile` block. I also updated the extract assertion comment in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts#L68) and narrowed the remaining debt in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md#L45).

Validation passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/extract/extract_test.ts tests/integration/extract_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

What’s next is narrower now: either replace or explicitly shape-test [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L317) together with the extracted-weave `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` ladder in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2470). I would still keep the larger `core/knop/create` / `core/integrate` / `core/knop/add_reference` graph-mutation rewrite out of this immediate slice.

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2235_00

Proceeding with the last narrow extract/weave seam. I’m inspecting the extracted-weave mesh-inventory rewrite and the extract located-file reorder together so I can decide whether to replace them cleanly or lock them down with explicit shape tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2236_02

I’ve decided not to hide a broader serializer rewrite inside this slice. The safest next move is to lock down the last two seams explicitly: add tests proving they fail closed on semantically equivalent-but-differently-serialized input, so the narrow remaining debt is intentional instead of accidental.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2236_11

I’m adding explicit failure-closed tests now. One targets the extract located-file reorder by changing only the source `LocatedFile` serialization; the other targets the extracted-weave ladder by changing only the current Bob Knop block to `rdf:type`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2236_30

The seam-guard tests are in. I’m running the focused extract and weave suites now; if they pass, I’ll update the task note to say the remaining seams are not just documented, they’re explicitly shape-tested.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2236_42

The seam-guard tests passed. I’m running `lint` and `check` now, then I’ll update the task note so it’s explicit that the remaining extract/weave seams are intentionally shape-tested, not silently unverified.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2236_57

I’m updating the task note first so the state doesn’t drift: the last extract/weave seams are still present, but they’re now explicitly guarded by failure-closed shape tests. After that I’ll inspect `core/knop/add_reference`, which looks like the smallest remaining mutation rewrite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2237_23

The task note is current again. I’m moving to Priority 5 now and starting with `core/knop/add_reference`, because it’s the smallest of the remaining line-oriented inventory mutators and should tell us whether a narrow graph-mutation pattern is worth extracting.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2237_37

`core/knop/add_reference` is the right next target: it only mutates a KnopInventory, not the whole MeshInventory. I’m checking the settled add-reference expectations before editing so I don’t accidentally collapse a pre-weave shape into a woven one.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2237_46

I’ve confirmed `knop add-reference` is still a pre-weave shape mutation over an already woven KnopInventory. I’m pulling the settled target file now to compare it against the current helper and see whether we can replace the mutation with a direct renderer instead of another graph serializer.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2239_44

I’ve got the shape split clear now. `knop add-reference` needs to support both unwoven KnopInventory input from `planKnopCreate` and woven KnopInventory input from the actual runtime. I’m patching it as parsed-shape classification plus two exact renderers, which is narrow enough to keep the settled fixture bytes stable.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2241_14

The core mutation rewrite is in place conceptually, but I need to tighten the new parser-backed shape checker and then add tests for both branches: woven runtime input and unwoven extract-style input. After that I’ll run the targeted add-reference suites.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2241_20

I’ve got the parser-backed brancher in place. I’m fixing the last compile issue and then adding two coverage points: one exact woven fixture test against `08-alice-bio-referenced`, and one unwoven branch test so the extract path stays covered even though it no longer consumes the rendered contents directly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2241_52

The add-reference tests now cover both supported input shapes and one equivalent-Turtle acceptance case. I’m running the focused add-reference suites first; if the new renderer branch holds, I’ll widen to `lint` and `check`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2242_11

`core/knop/add_reference` is green in both the core and integration suites. I’m running `lint` and `check` now, then I’ll update the RDF parsing note to mark that mutation rewrite complete and narrow the remaining work to `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2242_17

There’s one trivial lint issue from the rewrite: a leftover `referenceCatalogPath` local. I’m removing that, rerunning validation, and then I’ll update the task note to move `core/knop/add_reference` out of the remaining-debt list.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2242_23

The add-reference rewrite is otherwise holding. I’m rerunning `lint`, then I’ll tighten the task note so it only names `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate` as the remaining Priority 5 mutation work.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2242_27

The note still reflects the pre-rewrite state for `core/knop/add_reference`. I’m patching that now, then I’ll do one final status pass and stop unless you want me to roll straight into `core/knop/create`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2242_55

The note and validation are both current. I’m doing one final status/reference pass now so the close-out is precise about what landed and what the next slice actually is.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2243_07

Implemented the next two slices and updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md#L35).

- [add_reference.ts](../../src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L91) no longer rewrites KnopInventory by line splicing. It now parses the current KnopInventory, classifies unwoven vs woven carried shape, and renders the updated inventory directly while preserving the settled fixture bytes.
- [add_reference_test.ts](../../src/core/knop/add_reference_test.ts#L114) now covers exact woven output, unwoven input support, and semantically equivalent woven Turtle acceptance.
- I also locked down the last remaining extract/weave text seams with explicit failure-closed tests in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts#L134) and [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts#L819).

Passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/extract/extract_test.ts src/core/weave/weave_test.ts src/core/knop/add_reference_test.ts tests/integration/extract_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts tests/integration/knop_add_reference_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

The remaining Priority 5 debt is now just [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts) and [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts). The right next slice is `core/knop/create`, then `core/integrate`.

Commit message suggestion:

```text
core: replace knop add-reference inventory mutation with parsed shape renderers

- classify unwoven vs woven carried KnopInventory shapes with parsed RDF facts
- replace line-oriented knop inventory mutation with direct rendering that preserves settled fixtures
- add exact and equivalent-Turtle coverage for add-reference inputs
- shape-test the remaining extract and extracted-weave text-coupled seams
```

# User_2026-04-06_2258_37

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2258_53

Proceeding with Priority 5, starting from the remaining MeshInventory mutators. I’m checking `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate` side by side so I can see whether one parsed-shape classifier can cover both instead of doing two unrelated rewrites.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2259_44

I’m proceeding with the remaining RDF parsing debt in `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate`. First I’m re-reading the local guidance and the two mutators to confirm the smallest safe slice before editing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2259_51

I’ve confirmed the note and the two remaining mutators match the current debt list. Next I’m checking their tests and settled fixture expectations so I can replace string surgery with parsed-shape rendering without changing the intended bytes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2259_59

I have enough context to edit. Plan is straightforward: convert `core/knop/create` first to parsed MeshInventory shape classification and direct rendering against the settled fixture shape, then apply the same pattern to `core/integrate`, then expand tests from substring checks to exact-bytes and equivalent-Turtle acceptance.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2300_07

The ontology summary note moved or isn’t present at that path, so I’m not blocking on it. I’m pulling the exact settled MeshInventory fixtures next so the new renderers can preserve today’s canonical output instead of inventing a new serialization.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2301_02

I’m checking the existing `core/weave` mesh-shape assertions before I duplicate anything. If those already encode the same carried MeshInventory facts, I’ll borrow the same fact sets instead of inventing a second incompatible notion of “valid current mesh inventory.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2303_08

I’m editing `core/knop/create` now. The change is not a serializer refactor; it’s the same narrower move as the earlier slices: parse the carried MeshInventory facts, reject unsupported shapes, then render the settled target inventory directly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2304_26

`core/knop/create` is converted. I’m reading it back now for type or shape mistakes before I touch `integrate`; the exact same pattern needs to land there, so it’s cheaper to catch drift once.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2304_57

I’m applying the same narrow pattern to `core/integrate`. This one needs one extra step: parse enough of the current inventory to preserve the already-woven knop and identifier block, instead of hardcoding the current `alice` fixture into the renderer.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2306_58

The `integrate` rewrite is in. I’m doing a pass for missed call-site updates and obvious lint failures before I move to tests; these two files got large enough that small mismatches are the main risk now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2307_18

I’m updating the unit tests now. The previous tests were too weak for this slice; they only checked substrings, which would miss exactly the kind of silent output drift this parser-driven rewrite is supposed to prevent.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2308_30

The code is in place. I’m running formatter and a narrow test pass first, because the likely issues now are syntactic or type-level rather than behavioral drift.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2308_34

The formatter is clean. The unit tests are compiling now; I’m waiting on the first result before I widen to the runtime integration tests and the full lint/check pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2308_41

The parser-driven unit coverage is green. I’m updating the task note before the broader validation pass so the note matches the code if lint or type-check turns up a follow-on tweak.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2308_48

I’m narrowing the task note now. The implementation checklist should not keep pointing at `core/knop/create` and `core/integrate` once the code has moved; the real remaining debt is the explicitly guarded extract/extracted-weave seam, not those two mutators anymore.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2309_13

The note is aligned. I’m on the broader validation pass now: core unit tests plus the runtime integration fixtures, then lint and type-check. If anything remains, it’s likely to be a too-strict shape assertion or an unused constant.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2309_17

Lint found exactly the expected issue: a few ontology constants in `core/knop/create` are now dead after the rewrite. I’m removing those and then rerunning the full pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2309_35

Core and runtime integration coverage are clean, and lint is clean after the constant trim. I’m doing one last `check` on the final file state and then I’ll summarize the remaining considerations and the exact scope now left in the task note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2309_53

Implemented the remaining Priority 5 slice in [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts) and [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts). Both now parse carried MeshInventory quads, reject unsupported or already-registered shapes via RDF facts, and render the settled updated MeshInventory directly instead of mutating Turtle lines. I also strengthened [create_test.ts](../../src/core/knop/create_test.ts) and [integrate_test.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate_test.ts) to compare exact fixture bytes and accept semantically equivalent current MeshInventory Turtle, and updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) to mark the implementation plan complete.

Validation passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/knop/create_test.ts src/core/integrate/integrate_test.ts tests/integration/knop_create_test.ts tests/integration/integrate_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

Post-change, the meaningful remaining RDF debt is narrower than before: the explicitly guarded fail-closed seams in `core/extract` and extracted-resource `core/weave`. I would not keep extending this task into generic graph mutation unless those guarded seams start blocking Markdown payload publishing.

Commit message suggestion:
```text

```

# User_2026-04-06_2313_50

I feel trepidatious that we're doing all this in turtle, but maybe turtle is just the intermediary format and we can accept other RDF serializations too?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2314_07

I’m checking how deep the `.ttl` assumption actually goes before I answer, because the right answer depends on whether Turtle is just a parser choice or still part of the current storage contract.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2314_26

Your trepidation is reasonable, but the right distinction is:

Turtle should not be the internal model.
Turtle can still be the canonical on-disk format for now.

That is mostly where the code is landing. The recent RDF parsing work moves logic toward parsed quads and fact checks, which is the right internal posture. But the repository is still very much Turtle-native at the storage boundary: [create.ts](../../src/core/mesh/create.ts), [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts), and [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts) all still mint `.ttl` files and render Turtle directly.

So today, Turtle is not just an intermediary. It is part of the current filesystem contract.

What changed is narrower and still valuable:
- We are no longer treating Turtle text as the semantic model.
- We are increasingly treating parsed RDF facts as the semantic model.
- We still serialize the settled artifacts back to Turtle.

That is a good intermediate architecture.

I would not try to make the whole system serialization-agnostic right now. That’s a larger shift than “use RDF-aware parsing.” It would require:
- parser/serializer selection by media type or extension
- artifact metadata for serialization choice
- relaxing hardcoded `.ttl` paths and filename expectations
- deciding whether one artifact may change serialization across history states
- revisiting runtime checks that still assume `.ttl` payloads, like in [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts) and [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts)

My recommendation is:

- Keep Turtle as the canonical stored format for support artifacts for now.
- Keep moving operation logic onto parsed RDF graphs instead of Turtle text.
- Later, if needed, accept additional RDF serializations at ingest/export boundaries and normalize them into the graph model before writing canonical Turtle into the mesh.

That gives you the benefit you want without destabilizing the repository structure. If you want, I can add a short note to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) or the Markdown publishing task about “canonical Turtle storage vs multi-serialization ingest/export” so the concern is recorded explicitly.

# User_2026-04-06_2316_57

proceed

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2317_04

I’m adding the backlog note to `wd.todo.md` and keeping it narrow: canonical Turtle storage for now, possible multi-serialization ingest/export later, explicitly separated from the current RDF parsing cleanup.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2317_12

I found the idea already half-recorded in `wd.todo.md` as raw notes. I’m folding it into one explicit backlog item so it reads like the rest of the file and keeps the current recommendation clear.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2317_21

Added the backlog item to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md).

It now records the narrower stance explicitly: canonical Turtle on disk for now, with any future multi-serialization RDF support treated as ingest/export boundary work rather than a reason to destabilize current mesh storage.

No code or tests were changed for this note-only edit.

# User_2026-04-06_2318_10

proceed with additional seams?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2318_20

I’m proceeding with the remaining narrow seams from the RDF parsing note. First I’m re-reading the task note and the two guarded spots in `core/extract` and `core/weave` to see whether they can be converted cleanly without broadening the carried-slice contract.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2318_31

I have the remaining debt isolated now. I’m reading the surrounding planner flow before editing, because the right move is probably to stop patching planned Turtle and render the updated MeshInventory directly, not to replace one fragile reorder with another.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2318_37

I’ve confirmed the pattern: `extract` is still patching a prior plan output, and extracted `weave` is still editing the current Turtle in place. I’m pulling the settled `11`, `12`, and `13` MeshInventory fixtures next so I can render the target states directly instead of replacing substrings.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2319_03

I’m checking the existing extracted-weave shape assertions and helpers before I write new renderers. If those already capture the carried `12 -> 13` facts cleanly, I can reuse them instead of building a second near-duplicate parser seam.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2319_08

I need the settled `13` MeshInventory bytes before I replace the extracted-weave ladder. I’m pulling that fixture directly from the branch ref so the new renderer can target the actual current output, not an inferred variant.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2319_52

I found a more important consequence: after the `core/knop/create` narrowing, `extract` is now the wrong place to keep piggybacking on `planKnopCreate` for MeshInventory updates. I’m fixing that by giving `extract` its own parser-backed MeshInventory renderer, then I’ll replace the extracted-weave ladder the same way.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2321_01

I’m editing `core/extract` now. The goal is to stop depending on `planKnopCreate` for mesh updates entirely: validate the carried `11 -> 12` MeshInventory shape with parsed facts, render the settled `12` inventory directly, and keep the created Knop/ReferenceCatalog artifacts direct as well.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2322_28

The extract patch missed because the file has drifted a bit from what I expected. I’m reading the full file and then applying a tighter patch against the actual current text.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2322_33

I’ve got the actual file state now. I’m replacing the planner body in smaller chunks so I don’t disturb the surrounding normalization logic more than necessary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2324_26

The extract rewrite is in. I’m reading it back now before tests, because this change also removes a now-invalid reuse of `planKnopCreate`, so the main risk is a small logic hole rather than the renderer shape itself.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2324_31

The extract file formatted cleanly; I’m waiting on tests now. If they fail, it’s likely either an overly narrow shape check or a changed error contract around the old `KnopCreateInputError` reuse.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2324_50

The extract failure is a shape-check mismatch, not a renderer mismatch. I’m pinpointing which asserted fact is too strict against the real `11` fixture before I touch the tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2324_59

I found the first extract mismatch: I asserted `latestHistoricalState` on `_mesh/_inventory` instead of `_mesh/_inventory/_history001`. Fixing that before rerunning the extract tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2325_15

The extract shape check is narrowed correctly now. I’m rerunning the extract tests; after that I’ll update the old fail-closed test, because that seam should now accept semantically equivalent LocatedFile serialization rather than rejecting it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2325_28

I’m editing the extracted-weave MeshInventory renderer now. This one is simpler than the old ladder: the carried preconditions are already asserted up-front, so the remaining change is to render the settled `12 -> 13` MeshInventory directly from the known extracted-weave inputs.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2326_42

I’ve removed the extracted-weave ladder itself. Now I’m converting the two old guard tests from “fail closed” to “accept equivalent Turtle,” because those guards should no longer exist once the renderers stop depending on exact block text.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_00

The old seam-specific tests are now flipped to the behavior we actually want. I’m formatting and running the extract/weave test slice next; if that’s green, the task note can finally mark Priority 4 complete rather than just guarded.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_04

The extract and weave slices are compiling. I’m waiting on the full core plus integration result now; this is the point where a missing exact-byte detail in the direct renderer would show up.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_12

The remaining seam replacements are working against both core and integration fixtures. I’m updating the RDF parsing note now to mark Priority 4 complete and remove the stale “fail-closed remaining seam” framing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_43

The note update landed, but I’m doing one pass to remove stale wording about “remaining extract seam” so the document matches the code exactly before the final validation run.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_47

There’s one stale testing bullet left in the note that still talks about the old extract reorder seam as if it remained. I’m trimming that wording and then I’ll run the final lint/check pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2327_58

I’m on the final validation pass now: lint and type-check across the repo. The extract and weave core/integration slices are already green, so this last pass is mostly for unused imports or signature drift.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2328_01

The only cleanup left is dead code: `replaceExactOrThrow` is now unused after the extracted-weave renderer rewrite. I’m removing it and then rerunning lint.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2328_20

I’ve finished the additional seam replacements. I’m checking the final worktree state once so I can summarize the exact scope cleanly and call out the remaining risk, which is now mostly architectural rather than string-parsing debt.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2329_01

**Implemented**

[extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts) no longer piggybacks on `planKnopCreate` and then reorders MeshInventory text. It now validates the carried `11 -> 12` MeshInventory shape via parsed RDF facts and renders the settled extracted MeshInventory directly, while still preserving the `KnopCreateInputError` cause path for duplicate-knop cases.

[weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) no longer uses the extracted-weave `replaceExactOrThrow(...)` ladder for `12 -> 13`. It now renders the settled extracted-woven MeshInventory directly from the carried inputs after the existing parser-backed shape checks.

I also updated [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts), [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts), and [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md) so Priority 4 is now recorded as complete and the equivalent-Turtle tests now assert acceptance rather than fail-closed behavior.

**Verification**

Passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/extract/extract_test.ts tests/integration/extract_test.ts src/core/weave/weave_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

The remaining RDF debt is no longer in the carried extract/weave planners. What’s left is broader policy work, like canonical Turtle vs multi-serialization support, not these old text seams.

Commit message suggestion:
```text
core: replace remaining extract and extracted-weave mesh inventory text seams

- render extract mesh inventory directly from parser-backed carried shape checks
- stop reusing knop-create planning inside extract for mesh inventory updates
- replace extracted-weave mesh inventory replacement ladder with direct settled rendering
- update extract and weave tests to accept semantically equivalent current Turtle
- mark Priority 4 complete in the RDF parsing task note
```

# User_2026-04-06_2331_53

OK, so you think we're done with the "rdf-parsing" task?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2332_06

Yes, for the scope captured in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing.md), I would treat it as done.

The implementation plan in that note is now complete. The carried runtime and planner seams that were still interpreting RDF as text have been replaced with parser-backed fact checks or direct settled renderers, and the targeted tests plus `deno task lint` and `deno task check` are green.

What remains is adjacent, not this task:
- the backlog item in [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) about canonical Turtle vs multi-serialization RDF support
- the narrower metadata follow-up about requiring `sflo:meshBase` on the expected mesh subject
- any future non-carried graph-mutation work that is not part of the inventory in this note

So: materially complete, yes. I would not keep this note open just to absorb those broader follow-ons.

# User_2026-04-06_2333_41

Did we review these coderabbit suggestions:

Inline comments:
In `@src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts`:
- Around line 333-339: The function tryToMeshPath currently accepts IRIs with
fragment or query parts (e.g., "alice.ttl#v1" or "alice/bio?rev=1") which later
get concatenated as filesystem paths; modify tryToMeshPath(meshBase: string,
iri: string) so that after confirming iri.startsWith(meshBase) you compute
meshPath = iri.slice(meshBase.length) and then reject (return undefined) if
meshPath is empty OR if meshPath contains a fragment ('#') or query ('?')
character (i.e., check meshPath.includes('#') || meshPath.includes('?')),
leaving the rest of the logic unchanged.
- Around line 193-203: The current construction of linkSubjects (using
linkSubjectPrefix and quads) includes every fragment under the catalog resource;
change the filter so it only selects subject NamedNodes that both
startWith(linkSubjectPrefix) and have a matching quad in quads with that
subject, predicate "sflo:referenceRole" and object "sflo:ExtractedReference"
(i.e., ensure you check for the sflo:referenceRole sflo:ExtractedReference
marker before adding to linkSubjects); update the filter logic that builds
linkSubjects to perform this extra predicate/object check against quads to
restrict to extracted references.

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts`:
- Around line 304-317: The catch in the resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle call
contains unreachable branches; since resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle only
throws MeshMetadataResolutionError, simplify the handler to catch
MeshMetadataResolutionError and rethrow as IntegrateRuntimeError (using the
original error.message), and either remove the instanceof Error and final throw
or, if you want defensive future-proofing, replace them with a brief comment
stating the function currently only throws MeshMetadataResolutionError;
reference resolveMeshBaseFromMetadataTurtle, MeshMetadataResolutionError, and
IntegrateRuntimeError when making the change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2333_49

I’m checking those three spots directly in the current code so I can tell you whether they were already addressed and whether the suggestions are correct.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2334_00

I’ve confirmed those exact suggestions are not yet reflected in the current code. I’m checking the surrounding tests now to separate “real bug” from “cleanup-only nit.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2334_34

I found a more important issue while checking that second suggestion: the suggested predicate/object pair does not match the current project shape. I’m opening a real carried ReferenceCatalog fixture next so I can review it against the runtime loader instead of taking CodeRabbit’s wording at face value.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2335_03

I’ve finished the review. Two of the three comments are worth taking; one points at a real looseness but proposes the wrong RDF shape.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2335_34

Not before now. I reviewed them against the current code just now.

- The `tryToMeshPath(...)` comment is valid. [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L333) still accepts IRIs whose mesh-relative tail contains `#` or `?`, and downstream we do treat those as filesystem-ish paths. That should be tightened.
- The `resolveReferenceTargetDesignatorPath(...)` comment is only partially right. [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L193) is too loose because it grabs any fragment subject under the catalog. But CodeRabbit’s proposed fix is based on the wrong RDF shape. Current code renders `ReferenceLink` facts as `a sflo:ReferenceLink` plus `sflo:hasReferenceRole <...>` and `sflo:referenceTarget ...` in [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L486), and `core/weave` already parses that shape in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L1542). The runtime test at [inventory_test.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory_test.ts#L123) is actually the stale part here: it still uses `sflo:referenceRole sflo:ExtractedReference`. I would not implement CodeRabbit’s filter literally.
- The `integrate` catch simplification is valid but minor. [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts#L307) still has unreachable branches under the current [metadata.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts#L25) contract. That is cleanup, not a live bug.

So the right follow-up is:
- take the `tryToMeshPath` hardening
- simplify the `integrate` catch
- tighten `resolveReferenceTargetDesignatorPath`, but against the actual `ReferenceLink` model, not CodeRabbit’s outdated `sflo:referenceRole sflo:ExtractedReference` idea

If you want, I can patch those next.

# User_2026-04-06_2336_00

yes please

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2336_10

I’m patching the two real issues and the minor cleanup now: harden mesh-relative IRI handling, tighten extracted-reference discovery to the actual `ReferenceLink` shape, and simplify the stale `integrate` catch.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2336_16

I’ve got enough context. The runtime inventory test is still using the stale `sflo:referenceRole sflo:ExtractedReference` shape, so I’m fixing that test at the same time as the loader.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2337_24

I’m editing the runtime helper and its focused tests now. I’m keeping the extracted-link filter aligned with the current `ReferenceLink`/`hasReferenceRole` shape instead of the stale reviewer wording.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2338_06

I’ve patched the code. I’m adding one more focused assertion for fragment rejection so we actually cover both branches of the new path hardening.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2338_20

The targeted suite is running. If anything fails it will likely be the new extracted-link filter, because that’s where I intentionally tightened behavior.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2338_29

The focused tests passed. I’m waiting on the full typecheck now, then I’ll summarize exactly what was real in those review comments and what we changed.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2338_44

Reviewed and fixed the substantive parts.

The changes are in [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts) and [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts). `tryToMeshPath(...)` now rejects mesh-relative IRIs containing `#` or `?`, and `resolveReferenceTargetDesignatorPath(...)` no longer treats every catalog fragment as a candidate extracted link. I tightened that against the actual project shape, not CodeRabbit’s stale wording: it now looks for a fragment subject that is `a sflo:ReferenceLink`, points back with `sflo:referenceLinkFor <designator>`, and has a pinned `sflo:referenceTargetState`. The `integrate` metadata catch is also simplified to the real `MeshMetadataResolutionError -> IntegrateRuntimeError` mapping.

I updated [inventory_test.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory_test.ts) to match the real `ReferenceLink` shape, added a regression that ignores unrelated catalog fragments, and added coverage for rejecting query/fragment-tainted working file IRIs. I did not implement the literal `sflo:referenceRole sflo:ExtractedReference` suggestion because that shape is not what this repo currently writes or reads.

Verified with:

What do you think of these coderabbit comments:

Verify each finding against the current code and only fix it if needed.

renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle rebuilds the inventory with
only root/source/extracted entries, which silently drops unrelated mesh data;
fix by either (A) making
assertCurrentMeshInventoryShapeForFirstExtractedKnopWeave stricter to detect and
reject any extra mesh-related triples (compare the set of parsed quads against
the exact allowed set and throw with context) or (B) change
renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle to merge preserved quads from
parseWeaveShapeQuads (keep any quads whose subjects/predicates are not in the
rewritten set) instead of overwriting the entire document; update the logic
around parseWeaveShapeQuads, assertHasNamedNodeFacts, and the
rewrite/serialization in renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle
accordingly so unrelated knops/identifiers/deeper paths are either preserved or
cause a clear rejection.

Outside diff comments:
In `@src/core/weave/weave.ts`:
- Around line 588-642: The code currently never verifies that
referenceTargetSourcePayloadArtifact.workingFilePath matches the mesh
inventory’s current sflo:hasWorkingLocatedFile for that designatorPath, allowing
a caller-supplied/stale path to be written back; add a strict validation after
extractCurrentReferenceCatalogLinks and before
renderFirstExtractedKnopWovenMeshInventoryTurtle that compares the working file
path from the parsed current mesh inventory entry (derived from currentLinks or
the mesh inventory lookup you already assert via
assertCurrentMeshInventoryShapeForFirstExtractedKnopWeave) with
referenceTargetSourcePayloadArtifact.workingFilePath and throw a WeaveInputError
if they differ so planFirstExtractedKnopWeave cannot silently rewrite a
wrong/stale workingFilePath.

owner's subject (toAbsoluteIri(meshBase, designatorPath)) has a named-node fact
with predicate SFLO_HAS_REFERENCE_LINK_IRI and object subjectIri using the
existing hasNamedNodeFact helper (or equivalent); if that check fails, throw a
WeaveInputError with a clear message. Update the validation block in
extractCurrentReferenceCatalogLinks (near the existing hasNamedNodeFact and
requireSingleNamedNodeObject calls) to perform this owner-edge check so orphaned
ReferenceLink nodes are rejected.

Nitpick comments:
In `@src/core/knop/create_test.ts`:
- Around line 118-123: The withRdfPrefix helper should be made idempotent by
first checking whether the turtle string already contains an RDF prefix
declaration (e.g. a pattern matching "@prefix rdf:" or the RDF namespace URI
"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"); if present, return the original
string unchanged, otherwise inject the rdf prefix before the sflo prefix as
currently done. Update the withRdfPrefix function to perform this conditional
check (similar to the guard used in helpers in src/core/extract/extract_test.ts
and src/core/knop/add_reference_test.ts) so repeated calls won’t duplicate the
`@prefix` rdf: line.

these helpers into a single shared module (e.g. a new helpers/util) and export
them, then replace the copies in the current module (functions in create.ts) and
the equivalents in the other modules (the add_reference and extract
implementations) with imports from that shared module; ensure signatures remain
identical, update any import sites, and run/typecheck to fix any import paths or
lint errors.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2347_53

I’m checking each comment against the current code first. If a point is still real, I’ll patch only that item and rerun the relevant checks.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2348_09

I’ve checked the highlighted blocks. The formatting complaint looks stale; the larger extracted-weave shape comment may still be real, so I’m comparing it to the other carried-shape assertions before deciding whether to patch or reject it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2348_23

The formatter complaint is stale. I’m checking the two weave comments more carefully now: the owner-edge check looks like a good narrow hardening; the “stale working file path” claim may be off depending on what the mesh inventory actually carries for the source payload.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2349_03

I’m comparing the extracted-weave assertion to the stricter mesh-shape checks we already use in `core/knop/create` and `core/extract`. If it’s materially looser than those, I’ll tighten it instead of leaving a one-off data-loss hole.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2350_17

I’ve separated the comments into three buckets: stale formatter noise, narrow real hardenings, and one broader refactor suggestion I’m not taking. I’m patching the narrow real ones now in `core/weave` plus the low-risk idempotence fix in the test helper.

# User_2026-04-06_2350_34

regarding " unrelated knops/identifiers/deeper paths are either preserved or
cause a clear rejection.", we want preserved, right?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2350_49

Long-term, yes. If current mesh inventories may legitimately contain unrelated knops, identifiers, or deeper paths, preserving them is the right semantic behavior; rejection is only the safer short-term guard for a narrow carried-slice planner.

I’d separate the two choices clearly:

- `preserve` is the right product direction
- `reject` is the safer local patch when the code still renders whole Turtle documents from a narrow settled shape

I had started the narrow rejection hardening because it was the least invasive way to close the data-loss hole. If you want the correct long-term behavior here, I should pivot and make this seam preserve unrelated graph content instead of rejecting it. That is a bigger change than the other CodeRabbit fixes, but it’s the better answer if this planner needs to coexist with richer meshes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2350_54

Yes, if we’re talking about the intended behavior beyond the narrow carried-fixture phase.

Rejecting extras is a safe stopgap when a planner still rebuilds an entire Turtle document from a tiny known subset. But semantically, if the mesh inventory already contains unrelated knops, identifiers, or deeper paths, the planner should preserve them, not throw them away or reject them just because this slice doesn’t care about them.

That does change the implementation choice:

- `reject` means “keep the current direct renderer, but fail closed on anything outside the known slice”
- `preserve` means “stop treating the whole file as a slice-specific template and instead do a targeted graph update”

So my view is:

- short-term defensive patch: rejection is acceptable
- correct long-term behavior: preservation is better

Because you’ve said “we want preserved,” I would not keep the stricter-rejection version as the final answer for that seam. I should rework that part toward graph-preserving mutation instead.

# User_2026-04-06_2351_50

yes please.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2352_07

I’m pivoting that seam away from “reject extras” and toward preserving unrelated mesh content. First I’m inspecting the current extracted-weave renderer and tests so I can replace the whole-document rewrite without breaking the settled fixture path.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2352_39

I’ve got the design: preserve untouched subject blocks verbatim and only rewrite the extracted-weave subjects plus appended history/page blocks. I’m pulling the `12 -> 13` fixture diff now so I only touch the blocks that actually change.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2353_20

I have the exact `12 -> 13` mesh diff now. Only a handful of subject blocks actually change, which means I can preserve unrelated mesh content by replacing those subject blocks and appending the new `_s0004` blocks instead of regenerating the whole document.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2354_52

I’m swapping out the whole-document extracted-weave renderer now. The new path will preserve untouched mesh blocks verbatim and only replace or append the handful of blocks that actually change in `12 -> 13`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2357_02

I’ve got the bigger render replacement in place conceptually. Next I’m wiring in small subject-block helpers so the extracted-weave mesh update preserves everything else verbatim instead of reconstructing the whole file.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2357_37

I’m adding two lock-in tests for this seam: one to prove extracted-weave now preserves unrelated mesh blocks, and one to reject orphaned `ReferenceLink` nodes that aren’t actually owned by the designator.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2357_57

The preserve path is patched. I’m running the extracted-weave core tests first; if this falls over it will be in the new subject-block insertion order or one of the anchor assumptions.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2358_06

`deno fmt --check` caught a couple of line wraps in `core/weave`. I’m formatting that file and waiting on the test run.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2358_19

The type errors were from constants I’d removed too aggressively from the extracted-weave shape check. I’ve restored the required root/source path bindings and I’m rerunning the same core suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2358_23

The file is typechecking now. If the suite still fails, it will be a behavioral mismatch in block insertion or one of the new preservation tests.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2358_40

The stray insertion landed in the wrong mesh-shape helper. I’ve moved it to the extracted-weave assertion and I’m rerunning the same focused suite.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2358_46

The typecheck is clean again. I’m waiting on the runtime of the core weave tests now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2359_13

I’ve narrowed the remaining mismatch to two things: preserving the injected `rdf:` prefix from the test input, and one page-block insertion anchor. I’m normalizing the header back to the canonical mesh-inventory prefix set and fixing that anchor order now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2359_34

I’ve corrected the header normalization and the `_s0004` page anchor order. Rerunning the same core weave suite now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2359_38

The only thing left to prove is the test behavior. If this passes, I’ll run the corresponding integration suite plus lint/check to make sure the preserve path didn’t break the wider weave flow.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2359_45

The core weave suite is green. I’m running the corresponding integration tests plus lint and full typecheck now before I close this out.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-06_2359_49

Lint is clean. I’m just waiting on the integration weave test run and the full `deno check` to finish.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0000_04

I reviewed those comments against current code and only took the ones that were still real.

I did not take the `add_reference.ts` formatting comment. `deno fmt --check` was already clean there, so that review note was stale. I also did not take the “extract shared quad helpers now” refactor in [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts); that’s mechanical cleanup, not a bug fix.

I did take the substantive `core/weave` items, but with the preservation direction you called out. In [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), the extracted-weave mesh inventory path now preserves unrelated subject blocks instead of regenerating the whole document, while still validating the source payload working file against current mesh inventory facts and rejecting orphaned `ReferenceLink` nodes that are not declared via `sflo:hasReferenceLink`. I also made `withRdfPrefix(...)` idempotent in [create_test.ts](../../src/core/knop/create_test.ts), and added coverage in [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts) for preserving unrelated mesh inventory blocks plus the orphaned-link rejection.

Passed:
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/weave/weave_test.ts`
- `deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run=git,deno --allow-env src/core/knop/create_test.ts tests/integration/weave_test.ts`
- `deno task lint`
- `deno task check`

One caveat: this preserves unrelated subject blocks, which addresses the real data-loss concern. It still canonicalizes the specific rewritten subjects for the extracted-weave slice, so it is not yet a full quad-level “preserve arbitrary extra triples on rewritten subjects” solution. That would be a larger graph-update rewrite.

Commit message suggestion: `core: preserve unrelated mesh inventory blocks in extracted weave`

# User_2026-04-07_0001_43

Can you give an example of "“preserve arbitrary extra triples on rewritten subjects” and include it in [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md) ?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0001_51

I’m opening `wd.todo.md` to add the note in the right place and I’ll include a concrete example of what “preserve arbitrary extra triples on rewritten subjects” means.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0002_09

I found the right spot. I’m adding a backlog item that defines the preservation requirement with a concrete `bob/_knop` example rather than leaving it abstract.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0002_21

Added the example to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md).

The concrete case I recorded is: if extracted weave rewrites `<bob/_knop>` to add `sflo:hasResourcePage <bob/_knop/index.html>`, but that same subject already has unrelated metadata like `<bob/_knop> ex:importedFrom <https://example.org/source>` or `<bob/_knop> sflo:hasLabel "Bob Knop"`, a graph-preserving rewrite should keep those extra triples and only touch the triples this slice owns.

No tests ran; this was a note-only edit.

# User_2026-04-07_0003_28

"later mesh"?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0003_33

That phrase was sloppy.

I meant “a future richer mesh state” or “a later version of the product/data model,” not a later historical state in the mesh history. The point is just that the same subject might eventually carry extra triples that this current slice does not know about.

A clearer wording would be:

- “if a future richer mesh inventory also records unrelated extra triples on that same subject...”

If you want, I can tighten that wording in [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md).

# User_2026-04-07_0005_05

it's okay. I'm to tired to tell if that's an actual possibility. I'm assuming this is for inventory, which should only ever be written by the system.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0005_13

That’s a fair read.

If inventory remains a strictly system-owned canonical artifact, then “preserve arbitrary extra triples” is not an immediate requirement for user-authored data. In that model, the real risk is narrower:

- future Weave versions may add new system-generated triples to existing subjects
- an older rewrite path could accidentally drop those newer system-generated triples

So the backlog note is really about forward-compatible system evolution, not about humans hand-editing inventory.

If you want the stricter stance, I’d phrase it as: inventory is system-owned, so arbitrary third-party triples are out of scope, but rewrites should eventually preserve unknown system-generated triples on existing subjects.

# User_2026-04-07_0011_36

what's next?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0011_44

I’m checking the roadmap and the nearby task notes so I can answer from the repo’s current sequencing, not just memory.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0012_01

The next concrete task is still [wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md). [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) only has one loose near-term bullet, `allow naming of histories and states`, but the publishing note is the next real implementation-shaped slice.

I would not jump straight into code from that note yet, because its Implementation Plan is still blank. The right next step is to turn it into a narrow carried slice with explicit decisions about:

- one first consumer/profile
- one output surface, probably `docs/` or equivalent
- one Markdown baseline renderer
- one wikilink/frontmatter policy for the optional Dendron profile
- one fallback behavior for unpublished-but-linkable notes

So my recommendation is:

1. tighten the implementation plan in [wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-06_1905-markdown-payload-publishing.md)
2. pick the smallest first carried publishing path
3. then implement that slice

If you want, I can draft that implementation plan next.

# User_2026-04-07_0030_39

Before we jump into payload publishing, I want to be able to choose the history and state path segments, as this will be important for the ontology publishing scenario. See @wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md

Ask questions and help me fill that out.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0030_54

I’m reading the new task note and the nearby API/codebase context first so I can ask targeted questions instead of generic ones.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0031_45

After reading [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md), I think this needs to stay narrow or it will sprawl fast. `_history001` and `_s0001` are hardcoded all through `core/weave`, `integrate`, `payload.update`, `extract`, tests, and page generation. The first question is scope.

My recommended defaults, and the questions I need answered, are:

1. Scope: do you want this first slice to cover only payload artifact histories/states, or every artifact type?
I recommend payload artifacts first. Leave mesh inventory, Knop metadata/inventory, and ReferenceCatalog on the current generated `_history001` / `_s0001` scheme.

2. Creation point: should custom naming apply only when a history/state is first created, with no retroactive renaming?
I recommend yes. Renaming existing paths is a different migration problem.

3. Defaults: if the caller does not specify names, should behavior stay exactly as it is now?
I recommend yes. Keep `_history001`, `_s0001`, `_s0002`, etc. as the default fallback.

4. Path grammar: what counts as a valid custom segment?
I recommend “single path segment, no slash, preserve case, ASCII `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`”. Your `v0.0.1` example fits that cleanly.

5. Ordinals: should `historyOrdinal`, `stateOrdinal`, `nextHistoryOrdinal`, and `nextStateOrdinal` remain in RDF even when the path names become semantic?
I strongly recommend yes. Path name should be presentation/stability; ordinals should remain the machine ordering model.

6. First API surface: where should the names be supplied first?
My recommendation:
- `integrate`: optional `historySegment` when creating the first payload history later via weave is not enough if you want a named history root early
- `weave`: optional `stateSegment` for each newly created payload state
- possibly `weave` also needs `historySegment` when it creates a first payload history
- do not expose this yet on `knop create`, `knop add-reference`, or extracted-support weaving

7. Cross-artifact behavior: when one weave creates several histories/states in one operation, which artifact gets the custom name?
I recommend only the payload artifact being versioned. Support artifacts created in the same operation should keep system names for now.

8. Concrete ontology example: what exact path do you want to be able to produce?
For example, is the target something like `ontology/releases/v0.0.1/ontology-ttl/ontology.ttl`, or something else?

If you answer those, I can turn the note into a solid first draft with filled `Summary`, `Open Issues`, `Decisions`, `Contract Changes`, `Testing`, and a real implementation plan.

# User_2026-04-07_0043_27

1. fine to limit to payload histories/states. 2. custom naming for history only when a history is first created. States must be able to be given a name on every weave operation, even if that results in inconsistent naming. The tricky parts: you can't re-use names. Regardless, no re-naming, we want to keep to honor pseudo-immutability principle. 3. yes, if not specified behavior stays as it is now. 4. yes, conservative path grammar. 5. Yes, ordinals continue. 6. recommendations are good, I don't think knop create/add-reference or extract create the history or state dirs anyhow. we're talking about core, not CLI commands right? 7. Yes, since we're limiting to payload histories/states only, no need to worry about support artifacts. 8. example is exactly right.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0043_43

I’ve got your answers. I’m reading the repo guidance notes once, then I’ll fold these decisions into the task note and call out the remaining open questions that still matter before implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0043_49

I have enough to draft the note. I’m checking the ontology summary once because this task changes artifact/history naming semantics, then I’ll patch the task note with the decisions you’ve already made and leave only the truly unresolved points open.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0044_23

I’m checking the current `core/weave` request shape before I write the contract section, so the note names the likely seam instead of hand-waving.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0044_37

I’m patching the task note now with the decisions you’ve already made. I’m going to leave only the contract-shape questions open, mainly how a future `WeaveRequest` should carry names when it can target more than one designator.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0045_47

I’ve drafted the history/state naming note from your answers and I’m checking it for gaps before I hand it back. I’ll tighten any wording issues, then I’ll surface only the few decisions that still need your input.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0045_51

I’ve got the note into decent shape. One wording fix is still needed, and the remaining uncertainty is mostly the request shape for multi-target weave, not the semantics you just settled.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0046_03

Your answers already resolved two of the three “open issues” in the note. I’m narrowing that section so it reflects reality, then I’ll ask you the one remaining design choice that actually matters.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0046_22

I tightened [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md): fixed the wording glitch, removed the two “open issues” your answers already settled, and recorded that this is core-first and that history naming is supplied on the weave that first materializes the history.

At this point there’s really one design question left:

I recommend the first core contract use scalar optional fields on `WeaveRequest`, something like `historySegment?: string` and `stateSegment?: string`, and fail closed if custom naming is supplied on a weave request that targets more than one payload artifact. That keeps the first slice narrow and matches your ontology-publishing case. If multi-target named weaves become real later, we can move to a per-designator map then.

If you agree, I’ll update the note to make that explicit and fill in the request-shape section accordingly.

# User_2026-04-07_0047_22

We might need to update the ontology to be able specify what the current history name is

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0047_31

I’m checking whether this actually needs a new ontology term or whether the current history segment is already derivable from existing `ArtifactHistory` IRIs and mesh inventory links. Then I’ll tell you the narrower change, not just “add a field.”

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0047_49

I don’t think we need a new ontology property just to say what the current history name is.

We already have `sflo:currentArtifactHistory` in the core ontology at [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl), and that points to the actual `ArtifactHistory` resource. If the current history is `<ontology/releases>`, then the “current history name” is already derivable from that IRI’s last path segment: `releases`.

So I’d separate two ideas:

- Current history identity: already modeled by `sflo:currentArtifactHistory`.
- Preferred future history segment before a history exists: not currently modeled, and that would be a different thing.

For the task we just drafted, I would not add a new ontology predicate like `currentHistoryName`. That would duplicate the resource identity and create drift risk. The better move is smaller:

- keep `sflo:currentArtifactHistory` as the authoritative pointer
- allow its target IRI to be non-generated, e.g. `<ontology/releases>`
- keep `sflo:historyOrdinal` and `sflo:nextHistoryOrdinal` as machine metadata
- update ontology comments/docs to clarify that ordinals are not the same thing as the path segment and that the history IRI may use caller-chosen naming

If you want a persisted preference before first weave, that is the case where a new term might make sense, but it should be something like “preferred initial history segment,” not “current history name.”

My recommendation: update ontology documentation/comments, not the ontology shape, for this first slice. If you want, I can add that as a note in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md).

# User_2026-04-07_0049_15

I think we should allow custom naming on multiple targets, e.g. if SHACL gets the same release/vx.y.z naming. Note that I added an item to TODO that allow list-of-target specification.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0049_22

I’m checking the new TODO item and the current naming note against that multi-target direction. If the TODO really changes the contract shape, I’ll fold it into the task note instead of leaving the note internally inconsistent.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0049_31

Your new TODO item changes the answer to the last open question. Scalar naming fields are now the wrong shape; the first contract should be target-scoped so named multi-target weave is possible without inventing a second API later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0049_50

Yes. That changes the request-shape decision in a real way.

If `ontology` and `shacl` may both be woven in one operation with the same `releases` / `v0.0.1` naming, then scalar `historySegment` / `stateSegment` fields are the wrong contract. The naming inputs need to be target-scoped, and uniqueness should be enforced per artifact history, not globally.

I updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) to reflect that:
- multi-target custom naming is now an explicit decision
- the contract section now points toward target specs instead of scalar fields
- testing now includes a multi-target named weave case
- the remaining open issue is narrower: do we move directly to target objects, or temporarily keep `designatorPaths` alongside them for compatibility

My recommendation is to move toward a shape like:
```ts
targets?: readonly {
  designatorPath: string;
  historySegment?: string;
  stateSegment?: string;
}[]
```

and treat bare `designatorPaths` as legacy shorthand for unnamed/default targets, if we need a transition. That matches the TODO direction and avoids painting `WeaveRequest` into a corner.

The only question I’d keep open in the note is: do you want the first implementation to support both `designatorPaths` and `targets`, or do you want to cut straight to `targets` in core?

# User_2026-04-07_0736_37

I think we can cut straight to targets. Do we need another set of test data? Whether we need it now or not, we should probably move to a model where before and after states are captured in folders instead of branches. Are there any downsides to doing that?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0736_49

I’m checking how the current weave tests model before/after states so I can answer this concretely, not in the abstract. Then I’ll tell you whether folder-based fixtures are worth switching to now or later.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0736_54

The existing test corpus is still branch-backed, not folder-backed. I’m opening the fixture helper now, because that’s where the real tradeoff shows up.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0737_22

I’m recording the “straight to targets” decision now. I’m also adding a narrower testing note, because the history/state naming cases do not fit the current branch-backed Alice ladder cleanly.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0737_31

I’m also recording the fixture-model question in backlog, because it’s broader than this naming task and it touches CI, conformance manifests, and the carried-slice workflow.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0737_56

I updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) to record the `targets` direction, and I added the broader fixture-model question to [wd.todo.md](wd.todo.md).

For this naming task, I do think we need additional test data, but I do not think we need another branch ladder. The current harness is branch-backed in [mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts](../../tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts), and that was explicitly preserved in [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04-ci-dependency-fixes.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-04-ci-dependency-fixes.md). That corpus is good for the carried Alice slices, but it is a bad fit for new custom-naming cases. The cleaner move is a small naming-focused local fixture shape, probably before/after folders under `tests/fixtures/`, just for this task.

I think folder-backed snapshots are probably the better long-term model, but there are real downsides to a full switch:

- more duplicated checked-out trees, instead of letting git/history carry most of the reuse
- loss of the current branch-based carried-slice provenance and easy `git show`/`git diff` semantics
- migration cost across helpers, conformance manifests, and notes that currently refer to fixture refs by branch name
- risk of mixing “fixture storage redesign” into unrelated feature work

So my recommendation is narrow:

- cut straight to `targets` for the request model
- use a small local folder-based fixture set for the history/state naming task
- do not migrate the whole Alice branch-backed corpus in the same task

No tests ran; these were note-only updates.

# User_2026-04-07_0751_06

If the branch-based approach is worksable, we could do it. For example, we could use the 06-alice-bio-integrated branch as the before, and craft a new version of 07, call it 07a-alice-bio-named-history-woven, specifically for these new tests.

I accept your "cut straight to targets" reco.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0751_14

I’m checking the existing fixture ladder so I can answer your `06 -> 07a` idea against the actual branch corpus, not from memory. If it lines up, I’ll fold both decisions into the task note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0751_31

The `06 -> 07a` idea is workable, but not as the only test surface. I’m updating the note to reflect the stronger decision: `targets` is the contract, and the test plan should be hybrid rather than pretending one Alice branch variant covers every naming case.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0751_47

I’m checking one last thing before I answer cleanly: whether anything in Weave assumes branch refs start with a pure numeric prefix. If not, `07a` is mechanically fine, not just conceptually fine.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0752_00

Yes, that branch-based approach is workable. [mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts](../../tests/support/mesh_alice_bio_fixture.ts) treats fixture refs as arbitrary git refs, so a branch like `07a-alice-bio-named-history-woven` is mechanically fine, and the current ladder already gives us the natural anchors `06-alice-bio-integrated`, `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven`, `10-alice-bio-updated`, and `11-alice-bio-v2-woven`. I didn’t find any Weave test helper that requires a strictly numeric branch prefix.

The real downside is not the ref name, it’s the carried-fixture overhead: each variant wants a matching conformance manifest, branch docs, and ladder maintenance. That’s why I still think the right test model is hybrid: use branch-backed variants where they stay natural, and use small local fixtures for awkward cases like multi-target named weave. I updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) to reflect `targets` plus that hybrid testing plan.

One open question remains in that note: should this first task carry the new `targets` shape only through `core/weave`, or through runtime too, or all the way to CLI in the same pass? No tests ran; this was note-only.

# User_2026-04-07_0753_15

Why wouldn't we carry the new targets all the way to CLI? Has to be done someday.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0753_22

Because “has to be done someday” is not the same as “should be coupled to this exact task.”

The argument for stopping at `core` first would be:
- the semantic contract is still moving
- `targets` likely replaces today’s `designatorPaths` shape in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts)
- once that settles, runtime and CLI are mostly plumbing

The argument for carrying it through now is stronger if you already expect to exercise this feature manually soon, especially for ontology publishing. In that case, a core-only task would leave the feature half-real: implemented semantically, but not actually usable from the normal entrypoint.

Given what you’ve said, I think the right answer is: carry it through runtime and CLI in the same task, but keep the surface narrow.

Concretely, I’d recommend:
- `core/weave`: switch to `targets`
- `runtime/weave`: accept and pass through `targets`
- CLI `weave`: add a minimal way to supply one or more target specs
- keep the first CLI syntax intentionally plain, even if it is a bit clunky
- do not broaden the same task into recursive target selection UX, daemon support, or config-file policy

The real risk is not “doing CLI too early.” The real risk is bundling two changes at once:
- new target model
- polished CLI ergonomics

We should do the first now and defer the second.

So my recommendation is to update the note so the first implementation goes all the way through CLI, but explicitly as a thin pass-through surface over the new core `targets` contract.

# User_2026-04-07_0755_21

yes agreed, please update the note.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0755_28

I’m updating the task note to make `targets` end-to-end, with CLI included as a thin pass-through over the core contract rather than a separate later phase.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0755_33

I’ve got the exact spots. I’m resolving the remaining open issue in favor of end-to-end `targets`, and I’m making the note explicit that CLI is included but only as thin plumbing, not a UX redesign.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0755_50

Updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md).

It now makes the end-to-end decision explicit:
- `targets` goes straight through `core/weave`, `runtime/weave`, and CLI
- runtime/CLI are framed as thin pass-through plumbing, not a separate UX redesign
- testing now includes runtime and CLI coverage, not just core/integration
- the only remaining open issue is the thinnest acceptable first CLI syntax for named targets

I didn’t run tests since this was a note-only update.

# User_2026-04-07_0802_51

What is your suggestion for CLI syntax?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0802_56

I’m checking the current `weave` CLI surface first so the syntax recommendation fits the existing option style instead of inventing a parallel idiom.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0803_00

The CLI files are under a different path than I expected. I’m locating the actual command modules now and then I’ll recommend syntax against the real parser shape.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0803_05

I’ve found the actual CLI entrypoint. I’m reading the existing `weave` and nearby command option patterns now so the recommendation uses the same style as the rest of the binary.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0803_36

My recommendation is a repeated `--target` option, where each occurrence is one atomic target spec.

Suggested first syntax:
```sh
weave \
  --target 'designatorPath=ontology,historySegment=releases,stateSegment=v0.0.1' \
  --target 'designatorPath=shacl,historySegment=releases,stateSegment=v0.0.1'
```

And for later-state-only naming:
```sh
weave --target 'designatorPath=ontology,stateSegment=v0.0.2'
```

And default behavior stays:
```sh
weave
```

Why I think this is the right first syntax:

- It matches the new `targets` model directly.
- Each target is self-contained, so multi-target requests are unambiguous.
- It avoids brittle parallel flags like `--designator-path ... --history-segment ... --state-segment ...` where grouping becomes unclear as soon as you repeat them.
- It is thin CLI plumbing, not a new UX system.
- It leaves room to add fields later without redesigning the syntax.

I would parse each `--target` into:
```ts
{
  designatorPath: string;
  historySegment?: string;
  stateSegment?: string;
}
```

I would also allow the short form:
```sh
weave --target 'designatorPath=alice/bio'
```
so unnamed targets still work explicitly.

What I would avoid for the first pass:

- scalar `--history-segment` / `--state-segment` flags
- positional mini-languages like `ontology@releases@v0.0.1`
- JSON blobs on the command line
- a `--targets-file` as the primary interface

If you want, I can update the task note to make this the recommended first CLI syntax.

# User_2026-04-07_0811_25

are targets recursive by default? probably not, but maybe we add a recursive flag to each target?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0811_34

I’m checking the current weave selection semantics first. The right answer depends on whether “no targets” already means “all weaveable candidates,” and whether explicit targets are currently exact-match only.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0811_51

Current behavior is:

- no request paths means “all weaveable candidates” in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L246)
- provided `designatorPaths` are exact-match only, not recursive, in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L253)

So for `targets`, I would keep the same default:
- omitted `targets`: all weaveable candidates
- provided `targets`: exact-match only by default

I would not make explicit targets recursive by default. That would be too surprising once naming is attached. A target like:

```ts
{
  designatorPath: "ontology",
  historySegment: "releases",
  stateSegment: "v0.0.1"
}
```

should not silently stamp that naming onto every descendant payload unless the caller asked for that.

If you want recursion later, I agree it belongs on each target, not as one global flag. Something like:

```ts
{
  designatorPath: "ontology",
  recursive: true,
  historySegment: "releases",
  stateSegment: "v0.0.1"
}
```

That gives you mixed requests like:
- exact `ontology`
- recursive `shapes`
- exact `docs/api`

The main caveat is overlap. In a first pass, I would fail closed on overlapping target specs, for example:
- `ontology` with `recursive: true`
- plus `ontology/shacl`

unless we have a clear precedence rule.

So my recommendation is:

1. `targets` are non-recursive by default.
2. If recursion is needed, add `recursive?: boolean` per target.
3. In the first implementation, either omit recursion entirely or support it but reject overlapping targets.

That keeps the contract coherent. If you want, I can update the task note with exactly that stance.

# User_2026-04-07_0813_49

I think we want recursion, let's just do it from the start. rejecting overlapping doesn't seem as good as "most specific wins".

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0814_02

I agree with the direction, but `most specific wins` only works if we define it narrowly enough to stay deterministic. I’m updating the note so recursion is first-class per target, and I’ll make the precedence rule explicit rather than leaving it as hand-wavy path matching.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0814_11

I’m making one additional constraint explicit while I patch this: `most specific wins` is fine for ancestor/descendant overlaps, but duplicate targets at the same specificity still need to fail closed. Otherwise the request becomes order-dependent.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0814_29

Updated [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md).

The note now treats recursion as part of the first `targets` contract:
- each target can carry `recursive?: boolean`
- explicit targets are still exact-match unless `recursive` is set
- overlapping matches resolve by most specific normalized `designatorPath`
- duplicate targets at the same specificity fail closed as ambiguous, so precedence never depends on input order

That gives you the behavior you want without making the matcher fuzzy. The remaining open issue is just the CLI spelling for per-target recursion. The obvious fit with the earlier CLI idea is something like:
```sh
weave \
  --target 'designatorPath=ontology,recursive=true,historySegment=releases,stateSegment=v0.0.1'
```

No tests ran; this was a note-only update.

# User_2026-04-07_0814_47

Are we ready to implement? In this chat or a new one?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0815_00

Yes. The task note is now implementable.

The only thing still “open” is CLI spelling, but it is not a blocker anymore. We have enough settled to code against:
- `WeaveRequest` moves to `targets`
- each target can carry `designatorPath`, optional `recursive`, optional `historySegment`, optional `stateSegment`
- explicit targets are exact-match unless `recursive` is set
- most specific matching target wins
- duplicate targets at the same specificity fail closed
- carry the contract through `core`, `runtime`, and CLI

I recommend a new chat for implementation. This thread is already long and planning-heavy, and the implementation will touch `core/weave`, `runtime/weave`, CLI parsing, and tests. A fresh thread started from [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) will keep the working context tighter.

If you want, start the new chat with: “Implement [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]]. Use the task note as settled unless blocked.”

# User_2026-04-07_0817_50

I renamed the tast to wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting. Do we capture that it's not just weave, but also validate and version and generate that should be target-ready? I think maybe we haven't implemented validate yet?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0817_59

I’m checking the renamed targeting note and the current command surface so I can answer against the actual repo state, not the intended architecture. Then I’ll tell you whether the note should broaden now or stay weave-scoped.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0818_12

I want one quick confirmation before I answer flatly: whether `version`, `validate`, or `generate` exist anywhere as first-class operations, or only as behavior folded into `weave`.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0818_29

Yes, we should capture it, but not by pretending those operations already exist as first-class surfaces.

Current repo state is:

- `weave` is the only implemented operation that really has multi-target selection semantics today in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts) and [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts).
- `version`, `validate`, and `generate` are not standalone commands or modules right now.
- `validate` exists only as internal RDF checks inside runtime operations, for example in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), [integrate.ts](../../src/runtime/integrate/integrate.ts), [update.ts](../../src/runtime/payload/update.ts), and [extract.ts](../../src/runtime/extract/extract.ts).
- `generate` is effectively folded into `weave` via page rendering in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts).
- `version` is also folded into `weave` planning rather than exposed separately in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts).

So my recommendation is:

- Yes, the note should say the `targets` model is intended to become the shared targeting contract for later target-aware operations such as standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate`.
- But the first implementation scope should still be `weave`, because that is the only real external operation that needs this contract right now.
- Do not spec detailed behavior for standalone `validate`/`version`/`generate` yet, because that would be inventing APIs before the operations exist.

So the right framing is:

- “This task defines the first shared targeting model.”
- “The first implementation applies it to `weave`.”
- “Later standalone `validate` / `version` / `generate` surfaces should reuse the same target model.”

Also: the rename to `targeting` makes the current note slightly mismatched, because the Goals section is still almost entirely about history/state naming. That should probably be cleaned up.

If you want, I can update the note now to make that distinction explicit:
- shared targeting model
- first implemented on `weave`
- later reusable by future `validate` / `version` / `generate` commands
- those future commands remain out of scope for this task

# User_2026-04-07_0820_03

yes, clean it up.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0820_17

I’m cleaning the note up around the rename now. The main fix is to separate “shared targeting model” from “history/state naming as the first payload-specific use of that model,” and to say plainly that standalone `validate` / `version` / `generate` are future consumers, not current implementation scope.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0820_50

I found the real mismatch. The note now says “Targeting,” but it still reads like a pure history/state naming task. I’m patching it so the shared target model is the main thing, and history/state naming is described as the first payload-specific use of that model.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0821_11

The first patch missed one exact line block. I’m reopening the note with a tighter patch rather than forcing a broad replacement.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0821_16

I’ve got the exact line map now. I’m patching the note in smaller hunks so the rename cleanup lands cleanly instead of half-converting the document.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0821_38

One block is still fighting the patch matcher. I’m splitting this into isolated edits now so the note gets cleaned up without wasting cycles on one large patch.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0822_16

The note is structurally aligned now. I’m doing one readback to catch any lingering “this is only a naming task” wording before I stop.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0822_26

Cleaned up [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md).

The note now says explicitly:

- this is a shared `targets` model task, not just a history/state naming task
- the first implementation-bearing consumer is `weave`
- standalone `version`, `validate`, and `generate` should reuse the same target shape later
- those standalone commands are not part of this task because they do not exist yet as first-class surfaces
- history/state naming is framed as the first payload-specific use of the new targeting model

I did not run tests since this was a note-only edit. One remaining reality check for implementation is that current `weave` still only plans one candidate at a time, so if we keep multi-target semantics in this task, the implementation either needs to broaden orchestration or explicitly stage the shared target model ahead of full multi-candidate execution.

# User_2026-04-07_0828_11

does targeting by designatorPath allow us to target only support artifacts? i.e. a payload artifact or inventory artifact? versioning payload, meta, config, or reference artifacts is always going to require an inventory bump too, and targeting inventory only for versioning probably doesn't make sense.

nb: created wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md, maybe we should consider splitting weave up before going farther with targeting?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0828_23

I’m checking the current `weave` semantics and the new `validate/version/generate` note before I answer, because the right boundary depends on what a designator path currently identifies versus what `weave` mutates around it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0829_12

Not as the note is currently framed, and I think that’s the right instinct.

A `designatorPath` target should identify a logical resource surface like `alice/bio`, not an internal support artifact path like `alice/bio/_knop/_inventory`. In the current code, `weave` selects a designator-root candidate and then resolves its attached support artifacts from inventory state in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L145) and [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L229). So “targeting by designatorPath” really means “target this resource and let the operation touch the support artifacts it owns.”

I also think your inventory instinct is mostly right, with one correction: inventory-only versioning usually does not make sense, because inventory is bookkeeping/coordination state, not the semantic thing you are trying to version. But “versioning payload/meta/reference always requires an inventory bump” is too strong. In the carried slices, some `weave` cases do advance `_mesh/_inventory`, and some do not. The operation may need local support-artifact updates, but that does not mean the support artifact is the target.

So I would draw the boundary like this:

- Shared targeting core: `designatorPath`, `recursive?`
- Operation-specific options:
  - `version` or `weave`: `historySegment?`, `stateSegment?`
  - `validate`: likely validation scope/options later
  - `generate`: likely generation scope/options later
- Not in the shared target core: raw support-artifact targeting by path

Because of that, yes, I think you should fill out [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) before going farther with targeting implementation. I would not necessarily split `weave` in code first, but I would split it conceptually first. Right now [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) still bakes version-specific fields into what is supposed to be a shared target model.

My recommendation is:

- keep `targeting` as the shared selection model
- move `historySegment` / `stateSegment` out of the generic target definition and into version/weave-specific request options
- use the new `validate/version/generate` note to decide which of those later operations, if any, should ever accept support-artifact-only scopes

If you want, I can update both notes to reflect that separation before any implementation starts.

# User_2026-04-07_0840_02

Maybe we'll try to avoid support-artifact-only scopes for now. But yes, historySegment/stateSegment only apply to payload artifacts. Can you fill out the wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate -- and why not split weave in code? What are the version-specific fields you're talking about?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0840_24

I’m reviewing the new `validate/version/generate` task note and the current `weave` composition points before I rewrite it. Then I’ll answer the code-splitting question against the current implementation shape rather than in the abstract.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0841_22

I’ve got the shape. I’m rewriting the new task note so it cleanly separates shared targeting from version-specific naming, and so `weave` is described as an orchestrator over `validate`/`version`/`generate` rather than the place where all of those concerns stay fused forever.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0842_06

The new note is in place. I’m doing one readback now to make sure it reflects the resource-root targeting decision cleanly and doesn’t accidentally reintroduce generic support-artifact targeting through the back door.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0842_15

I filled out [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md).

The note now captures the boundary I think we want:
- shared targeting stays resource-root based
- no support-artifact-only scopes in the first pass
- `historySegment` and `stateSegment` are version-specific, payload-only fields
- `validate` and `generate` should not carry those fields
- `weave` should become an orchestrator over `validate + version + generate`

On “why not split `weave` in code?”: I think we should split it, but by extracting real seams first, not by immediately adding three top-level wrappers around the current planner. Right now `weave` already has partial seams in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts). The problem is that the planner is still slice-shaped and effectively single-candidate, so a naive command split would mostly duplicate tangled orchestration.

The version-specific fields I meant are exactly `historySegment` and `stateSegment`. They affect creation of `ArtifactHistory` / `HistoricalState` paths and descendant paths, so they belong to `version` and to `weave` only because `weave` includes versioning. They do not belong to generic `targets`, and they do not belong to `validate` or `generate`.

No tests ran; this was a note-only edit. One follow-up I would recommend is reconciling [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) with this newer separation, because that note still treats naming fields as part of the generic target shape.

# User_2026-04-07_0846_08

"resource-root based" == Knop-based, right?

Yes, please reconcile. I'm guessing we do validate-version-generate first?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0846_15

I’m reconciling the two notes now. The targeting note still treats payload naming as part of generic targets, and that is the part that needs to be pulled apart.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0846_39

I’m narrowing the targeting note now. The main change is to pull `historySegment` and `stateSegment` out of generic targets and to stop promising multi-target weave behavior before the `validate/version/generate` split exists.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0847_23

“Resource-root based” is roughly “Knop-managed root,” yes, but I would phrase it as “designator-root resource,” not “Knop artifact.”

So:

- `alice`
- `alice/bio`
- `ontology`
- `ontology/shacl`

are valid resource-root targets.

But these are not:

- `_mesh/_inventory`
- `alice/_knop/_meta`
- `alice/_knop/_inventory`
- `alice/_knop/_references`

Those are support artifacts owned by the targeted resource surface. The operation may touch them, but they are not the thing you target directly.

I reconciled [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) with [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md). The targeting note now treats `TargetSpec` as just:
- `designatorPath`
- optional `recursive`

and pushes payload `historySegment` / `stateSegment` out to the version-oriented note.

Yes, I think we do `validate-version-generate` first, or at least first enough to settle the decomposition before implementing targeting. I do not mean “build three polished commands before anything else.” I mean:
- settle the decomposition boundary first
- then implement targeting against that cleaner model
- then carry the targeting through `weave`, and later into standalone `version` / `validate` / `generate`

Otherwise we keep forcing version-specific behavior into the generic target contract and into the current single-candidate `weave` planner.

No tests ran; these were note-only updates.

# User_2026-04-07_0912_15

Regarding open questions:
- For now, let's say no standalone versioning without generate, but eventually we should be able to "turn off" resource pages, which stops generation and (optionally or obligatorily removes ResourcePages)
- structured findings
- regarding generate being usable over in-memory states, that could maybe be useful, but only for in-memory resource pages; we can have it only work from the settled state for now
- I think recursive versioning has to be batched? So we don't leave a pass partially completed. So I guess "version" would always do "validate", and then could still potentially fail. Or should we not worry about "atomic recursive versioning" and just do best effort and version what we can?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0912_22

I’m updating the validate/version/generate note with your answers and tightening the recursive-versioning question, because that one still needs a design call rather than just prose.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0912_29

Your answers settle three of the four open issues. I’m recording those, and I’m tightening the recursive-versioning one into an explicit “batch, not best-effort” recommendation because versioning is the wrong place for partial success semantics.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_0912_52

Updated [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) with your answers.

The main design call I made explicit is: recursive `version` should batch, not best-effort. Best-effort partial versioning is the wrong default because it can leave the mesh halfway through a publication run with some histories advanced and others not. The right first posture is:

- validate/planning over the whole recursive target set first
- fail before writes if any target cannot be versioned cleanly
- then apply the batch

That is not full transactional atomicity yet. Filesystem writes can still fail mid-apply unless we add stronger staging/journaling later. But semantically, the operation should be batch-planned and fail-closed, not “version what we can.”

I also recorded:

- no standalone successful `version` without `generate` in the first pass
- later, if ResourcePages can be disabled, that should be a separate feature with explicit page-removal policy
- `validate` should return structured findings
- `generate` should work only from settled workspace state for now

And yes, “resource-root based” still means designator-root resources, which in practice are the Knop-managed roots like `alice`, `alice/bio`, `ontology`, `ontology/shacl`, not support-artifact paths.

No tests ran; this was note-only.

# User_2026-04-07_1004_23

OK, you can mark recursive version fails the entire batch as decided. Then ready to implement

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1004_53

I’m updating the note to treat recursive version failure as settled rather than still open. Then I’ll tell you whether anything important is still blocking implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1004_57

I’m marking the recursive-versioning question as decided and clearing the last open blocker from the note. After that, the task is ready to implement.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1005_02

Updated [wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) to mark recursive versioning as settled and clear the remaining open blocker.

Yes, this is ready to implement now. The sequencing I’d use is:

1. `validate-version-generate` first, at least enough to extract the real seams and separate shared targeting from version-only fields.
2. then carry the narrowed `targets` model through `weave`
3. then decide when to expose standalone CLI commands versus keeping them internal a bit longer

No tests ran; this was a note-only update.

# User_2026-04-07_1435_21

OK, are we ready to implement?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-07_1435_30

Yes.

[wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md](wd.task.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate.md) and [wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md](wd.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting.md) are now aligned enough to start code.

The key settled points are:

- shared targeting is resource-root based, not support-artifact based
- `historySegment` / `stateSegment` are version-specific, not generic target fields
- `weave` should be decomposed toward `validate + version + generate`
- recursive versioning is batch-planned and fail-closed, not best-effort
- standalone `generate` is settled-state-only for now
- standalone `validate` returns structured findings

I’d still recommend a new implementation chat, because this thread is now mostly planning and note work. A good kickoff would be:

Implement [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0820-validate-version-generate]] first. Use [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-07_0020-targeting]] as the targeting contract, but do not put payload naming fields into generic `TargetSpec`.
