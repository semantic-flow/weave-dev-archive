## Goals

- Dogfood Weave on the live `sflo` ontology repo before attempting the URPX build.
- Treat `sflo:main` as clean source and use a branch-published mesh publication branch, probably `gh-pages`, as the woven/published state.
- Produce browsable ResourcePages for the core ontology, config ontology, SHACL, and supporting ontology artifacts with friendly history and state paths.
- Surface release-blocking gaps in branch-published mesh setup, deploy ergonomics, source provenance, and config defaults.
- Keep the workflow repeatable enough to become a small runbook for URPX and other ontology repos.

## Summary

The next useful dogfood step is to build a branch-published Semantic Flow mesh for `dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo`. This should exercise the same class of behavior URPX will need, but with an ontology we understand deeply and can inspect quickly.

The intended repository shape is:

- `main`: source-only ontology repository, suitable for normal ontology editing.
- `gh-pages`: woven/publication branch containing Weave support artifacts, generated ResourcePages, and source provenance that points back to source files and source commits on `main`.

This should not become an Alice-style fixture ladder yet. The first pass is a practical dogfood build: bootstrap the mesh, publish it, inspect the output, and record the sharp edges.

## Discussion

This task is primarily about release confidence. If Weave can publish the `sflo` ontology with good ResourcePages and understandable history/state paths, then URPX becomes a much cleaner external acceptance test. If `sflo` exposes missing config behavior, we can fix that before adding URPX-specific noise.

The branch-published setup is also the right model for ontology repos that want their source branch to stay clean while GitHub Pages serves the generated mesh. That means the publication branch cannot be treated like a sidecar `docs/` mesh. We should expect deploy commands to read from one worktree and write to another.

The one-worktree limitation matters. Git will not let the same branch be checked out in two worktrees at once, and a single worktree cannot simultaneously be on `main` and `gh-pages`. For this task, use `dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo` as the canonical source checkout on `main`, and use a separate temporary or dependency-local publication worktree for `gh-pages`. Before creating a publication worktree, check `git worktree list` so we do not collide with an existing checkout of `gh-pages`.

The publication worktree can be disposable during experimentation. Once the process stabilizes, decide whether to keep a named worktree under `dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo-gh-pages` or recreate it as needed. Avoid putting generated publication output into the source checkout unless we intentionally switch that checkout to `gh-pages` for preview.

## Settled Issues

- All-terms extraction should create source references only when explicitly requested with `--add-source-references --reference-role canonical`; extraction provenance remains separate from curated reference links.
- All-terms extraction should consider every mesh-scoped named node in subject, predicate, or object position.
- Resources typed `sflo:LocatedFile` are support/file resources and should not be extracted into Knops.
- The initial core/config/SHACL files are `integrate` inputs for the publication mesh, not `import` inputs. `import` is for outside-origin or extra-workspace content that first needs to become a governed local artifact.

## Working Answers

- Use `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/` as the public mesh base for this pass.
- Start with `semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl`, `semantic-flow-config-ontology.ttl`, and `semantic-flow-core-shacl.ttl`. Do not include `semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl` or `semantic-flow-job-ontology.ttl` until the first three files have healthy pages, source provenance, and generated links.
- Keep `sflo:main` clean for now. The normal durable mesh config should live on `gh-pages` under `_mesh/_config/config.ttl`, because it describes the publication mesh. First-bootstrap settings can be CLI/profile/CI/operator input, not source-branch files.
- Revisit source-side bootstrap config only if repeated dogfood or URPX setup needs reviewable, repo-carried publication intent that cannot reasonably live on the publication branch or in CI/operator input.
- There is no existing `gh-pages` branch, so the first pass should create a new publication branch/worktree rather than force-reset existing publication history. After that, normal dogfood runs should preserve and update the publication branch incrementally.
- Use `/tmp/weave-logs/sflo` as the explicit out-of-repo log directory for dogfood commands.
- Record source provenance with the exact observed source commit as the durable provenance anchor, and also record `main` as the source ref/context when the source was read from that lane. If a downstream consumer needs one value to prove what bytes were published, the commit wins.
- An Accord scenario is valuable as a pinned, invariant-based release preflight, not as a moving golden fixture over live `sflo:main`. Keep stable conformance fixtures in smaller controlled repos such as Fantasy Rules; use `sflo` to prove real ontology pressure without pretending it is frozen.
- Wait on an `sflo` Accord/conformance scenario until after the dogfood path works. Because `sflo` will continue to change, the scenario can be added later as a pinned or invariant-style preflight without blocking the current build.
- Use `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/config` as the config ontology base if/when the config namespace moves for this dogfood run.
- Create a root payload for the mesh root so `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/` is a first-class Semantic Flow identifier, not only the mesh base. `integrate welcome.ttl /` creates the root Knop support surface; use `knop.create /` only when creating an empty root identifier before any payload exists.
- Add a small root welcome/about RDF payload on the publication branch, tentatively `welcome.ttl`, with root-page facts such as `dcterms:title` and `dcterms:description`. The description can reuse or lightly adapt the text from [[ont.purpose]].
- Do not introduce a `SemanticSite` or special site resource concept for this. The root designator can identify this publication's welcome/about resource, while `_mesh` remains the standardized `SemanticMesh` resource.
- Prefer the root RDF payload plus the default ResourcePage renderer for the first pass. A custom `_knop/_page/page.ttl` is only needed if the default ResourcePage look and feel is not enough.
- Treat Markdown-in-RDF as a possible lightweight future path for richer descriptive copy. For this run, plain RDF literals are enough unless the renderer needs a specific Markdown-aware predicate/datatype later.

## Sequencing

The branch-published dogfood should exercise the same flow we want URPX to use. Manually specifying every ontology term would dodge one of the most important ontology-publishing pressures, so all-terms extraction should be part of the publication sequence once the source ontology artifacts are integrated and woven.

Current Weave has `weave extract --all-terms --source ...` plus preview/accept-preview behavior. It discovers mesh-scoped named terms in a selected RDF payload, skips existing Knops, skips generated support artifacts, skips `sflo:LocatedFile` resources, and can create source references with explicit `--add-source-references --reference-role canonical`.

The proposed sequence is:

- settle the config base before extraction, because terms outside `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/` will not be treated as first-class mesh terms by ordinary mesh-scoped discovery;
- create a separate `gh-pages` publication worktree and run `mesh.create` there with `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/` as the public mesh base;
- create `welcome.ttl` in the publication branch and integrate it at `/`, which creates the root Knop and lets the default root ResourcePage render title/description from RDF;
- integrate the three initial source-lane files as publication-mesh payload artifacts: `semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl`, `semantic-flow-config-ontology.ttl`, and `semantic-flow-core-shacl.ttl`;
- weave/version those three payload artifacts with friendly release/history/state/manifestation names;
- run `weave extract --all-terms --source ... --add-source-references --reference-role canonical` for each integrated ontology/SHACL source artifact whose terms should become first-class identifiers;
- weave/generate the extracted terms and inspect the root page, ontology pages, term pages, source-reference panels, and support pages;
- defer Accord/conformance packaging until the manual dogfood output proves which invariants are worth capturing.

This sequence deliberately says `integrate`, not `import`, for the initial three source files. They are already known source-repository files being bound into the publication mesh. Use `import` later for outside-origin content that needs to cross into a governed local artifact before pages or weave follow it.

## Root Welcome Metadata Sketch

The first root payload can stay intentionally small. A draft `welcome.ttl` could look like:

```ttl
@base <https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<> dcterms:title "Semantic Flow Ontology and Related Resources" ;
  dcterms:description "The Semantic Flow core ontology and other related resources provide a way to create identifiers that are dereferenceable, resilient, and explorable. It formalizes how Semantic Flow designators, supporting artifacts, and optional payload resources can be combined to make these identifiers useful." .
```

That is enough for the default ResourcePage renderer to pick up a title and description from RDF when the file is integrated at `/`. If we later want richer authored copy, consider a Markdown literal in RDF before adding a custom page-definition artifact; the custom `_knop/_page/page.ttl` path should be reserved for cases where the default page composition is genuinely insufficient.

## Bootstrap Config Evaluation

The useful split from [[wa.task.2026.2026-05-13_1655-support-gh-pages-branch-based-deployments]] still holds: operation-local checkout paths are not durable mesh facts, while source provenance and target bindings are durable publication facts.

For this dogfood pass, bootstrap input can stay outside `sflo:main` when it only says how this run is wired locally:

- source checkout root;
- publication worktree root;
- publication branch name;
- whether to create `.nojekyll`, a local commit, or a dry-run plan;
- first-run source binding arguments for one invocation;
- explicit local log directory such as `/tmp/weave-logs`.

Bootstrap config starts to justify a persistent home when it captures stable publication intent rather than one operator's checkout topology:

- canonical mesh base and Pages source folder assumptions;
- ordered source-to-designator bindings for core/config/SHACL and later ontology artifacts;
- source repository URL, default source ref, and whether to record exact observed commits;
- target materialization paths in the publication branch;
- source-binding refresh policy, digest expectations, or pinning policy;
- publication controls such as `.nojekyll`, preserved files, local commit policy, and rebuild/force-reset guardrails;
- ResourcePage generation and presentation defaults that should survive across runs;
- config-resolution/profile choices that narrow behavior without granting new host trust.

If that persistent bootstrap profile is needed, prefer one of these homes, in order:

- `gh-pages` durable mesh config for facts about the published mesh and source bindings;
- CI/deploy workflow configuration for repeatable automation of checkout paths, branch names, and credentials;
- an operator-local profile for machine-specific paths or trust grants.

Avoid putting bootstrap config on `main` unless the source repo deliberately wants publication intent reviewed with source changes. F

## `/ontology` Review

Some `/ontology` strings are expected because `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/ontology/...` is the current core ontology namespace under the `sflo` site. The cleanup candidates are the older standalone `https://semantic-flow.github.io/ontology/...` and `https://github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/...` references:

- `semantic-flow-config-ontology.ttl` has moved to the slashless ontology IRI `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/config` with term namespace `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/config/`.
- `semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl` uses the `sflo` ontology IRI, but `vann:preferredNamespaceUri` still says `https://semantic-flow.github.io/ontology/core/`, and `owl:versionIRI` / one `dcat:downloadURL` still point at `github.com/semantic-flow/ontology`.
- `semantic-flow-core-shacl.ttl` uses the `sflo` ontology IRI, but `owl:versionIRI` and one `dcat:downloadURL` still point at `github.com/semantic-flow/ontology`.
- `semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl` and `semantic-flow-job-ontology.ttl` are still on the standalone `/ontology/prov` and `/ontology/job` bases, but those are outside the initial core/config/SHACL slice.

The config namespace now sits under the `sflo` mesh base, so ordinary mesh-scoped extraction can treat config terms such as `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/config/Config` as first-class identifiers with designator paths under `config/...`.

## Decisions

- Treat `main` as source-only and `gh-pages` as the woven/publication branch.
- Use a separate publication worktree for `gh-pages`; do not try to use one checkout for both source and publication operations.
- Keep the first pass practical and release-focused rather than building a full fixture ladder immediately.
- Prefer command-driven Weave operations over hand-editing generated publication artifacts.
- Use `/tmp/weave-logs` or another explicit out-of-repo log directory during dogfood commands.
- Use `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/` as the dogfood mesh base.
- Start with core, config, and SHACL only.
- Keep source-side bootstrap config off `main` unless the dogfood run proves that repo-reviewed publication intent is worth the source-branch footprint.
- Create the first `gh-pages` publication branch from scratch because no existing branch/history needs preservation.
- Use `/tmp/weave-logs/sflo` for dogfood logs.
- Treat exact source commit metadata as the authoritative provenance for published bytes, with `main` recorded as refresh context when applicable.
- Treat any future `sflo` Accord work as a pinned or invariant-based preflight scenario, not a reliable mutable fixture.
- Use `https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo/config` as the preferred config ontology base.
- Implement or verify bulk source-reference creation for all-terms extraction before relying on the `sflo` dogfood output.
- Create a root payload such as `welcome.ttl` for root title/description; integrating it at `/` creates the root Knop.
- Treat the initial core/config/SHACL files as integrated source-repository payloads, not imports.
- Defer the `sflo` Accord/conformance scenario until the dogfood run exposes stable invariants worth checking.

## Contract Changes

- No runtime contract change is intended at task start.
- The dogfood run may reveal needed config defaults or CLI behavior changes for branch-published meshes.
- Any behavior change that affects portable Semantic Flow expectations should update the relevant `sf.spec.*` note in the Semantic Flow Framework repo.
- Any Weave-local CLI or release workflow behavior should be recorded in Weave developer notes, especially [[dev.release-runbook]] if it affects release preflight.

## Testing

- Before code changes, record the exact commands used to bootstrap and publish `sflo`.
- Run focused Weave tests for any code changes discovered during dogfood.
- Run `deno task check` and `deno task lint` after significant code changes.
- Run `deno task ci` before treating this dogfood run as release confidence.
- Locally preview the generated publication branch with a mounted live server or equivalent so absolute/public links behave like GitHub Pages.
- Inspect representative ResourcePages:
  - the root mesh page;
  - `semantic-flow-core-ontology`;
  - key classes such as `DigitalArtifact`, `ResourcePage`, `Knop`, `ArtifactHistory`, and `HistoricalState`;
  - config ontology terms;
  - SHACL shapes.

## Non-Goals

- Do not publish to npm as part of this task.
- Do not turn this into a full fixture ladder unless we deliberately create a follow-up.
- Do not move source ontology files into a sidecar `docs/` layout.
- Do not hand-author generated `gh-pages` ResourcePages except to diagnose whether Weave needs a code/config fix.
- Do not add compatibility shims for old publication branch shapes unless they are necessary for the current release.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Implement or verify all-terms extraction with bulk source-reference creation.
- [ ] Integrate or source-bind `semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl` from `main`.
- [ ] Weave/generate ResourcePages for the core ontology artifact.

- [ ] Defer prov/job artifacts until the core/config/SHACL slice has been inspected.
- [ ] Preview the publication worktree locally and inspect representative pages.
- [ ] Record any release-blocking gaps in config defaults, history/state naming, source provenance, generated links, or CLI ergonomics.
- [ ] Run focused tests for any patches, then `deno task check`, `deno task lint`, and `deno task ci`.
- [ ] Update [[dev.release-runbook]] with the final dogfood commands if they become release preflight steps.
