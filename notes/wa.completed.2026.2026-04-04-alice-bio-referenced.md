## Goals

- Carry the next real local semantic slice after the completed `06-alice-bio-integrated` -> `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` payload weave.
- Implement the first local or in-process path for creating a Knop-owned `ReferenceCatalog` and `ReferenceLink` over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Reuse the same spec, test, and acceptance pattern already used for earlier carried slices.
- Keep this first reference-catalog implementation narrow enough to prove managed reference behavior without absorbing woven catalog history or later referenced-resource extraction.

## Summary

This task should pick up after the carried local `06-alice-bio-integrated` -> `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` `weave` slice.

The next carried slice should target the settled Alice Bio transition from `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` to `08-alice-bio-referenced`.

The target behavior is deliberately narrow:

- update `alice/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl` so the `alice` Knop has `hasReferenceCatalog <alice/_knop/_references>`
- create `alice/_knop/_references/references.ttl`
- create one canonical `ReferenceLink` rooted at `<alice/_knop/_references#reference001>`
- make that link be about `<alice>` and target `<alice/bio>`
- leave `_mesh/_inventory`, `alice/bio` payload state, histories, and generated pages unchanged

This task should prove the first real non-woven managed-reference path without absorbing `09` weaving behavior, richer catalog page generation, or `bob` extraction.

## Discussion

### Why this is the next slice

The settled fixture ladder already makes the next carried sequence clear:

- semantic change
- weave

After `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven`, the next missing implementation-bearing step is the first non-woven reference-catalog change, not another weave-only slice and not a cross-cutting cleanup task.

Jumping ahead would leave a real gap:

- payload weaving would exist
- but the first managed `ReferenceCatalog` / `ReferenceLink` semantic change would still be unimplemented

### Why this slice should stay narrow

The settled `08` fixture is specific enough to carry a real slice without opening the whole reference-management family.

For `08-alice-bio-referenced`, the current expected behavior is:

- `_mesh/_inventory/inventory.ttl` stays unchanged
- `alice/_knop/_meta/meta.ttl` stays unchanged
- `alice/_knop/_inventory/inventory.ttl` gains `hasReferenceCatalog <alice/_knop/_references>`
- `alice/_knop/_references/references.ttl` appears as the first working catalog surface
- the `ReferenceLink` is attached to `<alice>`, not to `<alice/_knop>` or `<alice/bio/_knop>`
- no new history or page generation appears yet

That is enough to prove:

- first Knop-owned `ReferenceCatalog` creation
- first stable catalog-fragment `ReferenceLink` identity
- the distinction between a semantic catalog change and later `09` weave behavior

### Existing spec posture

This task should use a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]] note before implementation.

Unlike the carried `weave` slices, there is no existing broad behavior note that already covers the first non-woven reference-catalog operation. The task should use [[ont.reference-links]] as the detailed ontology companion, but it should still define a narrow Weave-facing behavior spec for the first local or in-process path.

### Why not make RDF parsing the next carried task

The existing [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-04_0952-rdf-parsing]] note is legitimate, but it is a cross-cutting cleanup task rather than the next semantic slice.

It should not block the next carried fixture transition unless this reference-catalog work directly exposes a specific parsing failure that must be addressed immediately.

### One fixture diff should not be treated as intended behavior

The settled `07` -> `08` fixture diff includes a whitespace-only change in `alice/_knop/_meta/_history001/_s0001/meta-ttl/meta.ttl`.

That should be treated as incidental fixture noise rather than intended semantic behavior for this task. The meaningful behavior in this slice is the Knop inventory update plus the new references catalog file.

## Resolved Questions

- This slice should get a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]] note before implementation. The behavior is externally visible, crosses `core`, `runtime`, CLI, and acceptance layers, and already has a manifest-backed fixture target.
- The first local CLI surface should be `weave knop add-reference <designatorPath> --reference-target-designator-path <referenceTargetDesignatorPath> --reference-role <referenceRole>`. Keep `knop.addReference` as the machine-facing job kind and manifest `operationId`, but keep the human-facing CLI aligned with the existing `mesh create` and `knop create` subcommand pattern.
- The first local request/result boundary should stay narrow. Shared `core` and `runtime` should accept the target `designatorPath`, one `referenceTargetDesignatorPath`, and one `referenceRole`, resolve IRIs from the existing `meshBase`, and report the created `referenceCatalogIri`, `referenceLinkIri`, and created or updated paths.
- The first slice should derive `referenceLinkFor` from the targeted Knop's `designatorPath`, not take an explicit subject override.
- `ReferenceRole` should be an input rather than being hard-coded in the first slice, but this carried local path should require it explicitly rather than silently defaulting to `Supplemental`. The settled `08` target is specifically `Canonical`, and the later Bob extraction path is the first natural carried `Supplemental` case.

## Decisions

- Treat `07-alice-bio-integrated-woven` -> `08-alice-bio-referenced` as the next carried implementation slice.
- Add a dedicated [[wd.spec.2026-04-04-knop-add-reference-behavior]] note before implementation.
- Keep the first implementation local or in-process over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- Use the settled Alice Bio `08-alice-bio-referenced` manifest and fixture as the first acceptance target.
- Scope the first slice to the existing `alice` Knop-owned case with one canonical `ReferenceLink` targeting `alice/bio`.
- Make the first local CLI surface `weave knop add-reference <designatorPath> --reference-target-designator-path <referenceTargetDesignatorPath> --reference-role <referenceRole>`, while keeping `knop.addReference` as the machine-facing job kind and manifest `operationId`.
- Keep the first local request shape narrow: target `designatorPath`, one `referenceTargetDesignatorPath`, and one `referenceRole`, with `meshBase` resolved from the existing workspace.
- Keep `referenceLinkFor` implicit from the targeted Knop's referent rather than accepting a separate subject IRI input.
- Require `referenceRole` explicitly in this first carried local slice rather than silently defaulting it.
- Keep the semantic subject of the link as `<alice>` rather than drifting into Knop-about-Knop semantics.
- Leave `09` weave behavior, catalog history, dereferenceable current catalog pages, and retired-link handling for the following woven slice.
- Keep the broader RDF-parsing cleanup task separate unless this slice reveals a direct blocker.

## Contract Changes

- This task may introduce the first thin public request/result examples for `knop.addReference` in `semantic-flow-framework`, including one explicit `referenceRole`.
- This task should not attempt to finalize the full contract for multi-link updates, role selection, explicit subject override, `referenceTargetState`, or mesh-owned catalogs.

## Testing

- Follow [[wd.testing]].
- Add failing unit tests for the next narrow planning logic where practical, especially stable link identity, role handling, and inventory updates.
- Add integration tests for local filesystem results against the settled `08-alice-bio-referenced` fixture target.
- Add a black-box CLI acceptance test scoped by the settled `08-alice-bio-referenced` Accord manifest.
- Keep the comparison black-box and fixture-oriented rather than coupling tests to helper internals.

## Non-Goals

- implementing `09-alice-bio-referenced-woven`
- implementing current or historical catalog page generation
- implementing retired-link anchor preservation
- implementing multiple-link batch edits
- implementing `referenceTargetState`
- auto-creating `bob` or other referenced-resource Knops
- addressing the full RDF-parsing cleanup task

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Decide whether the first reference-catalog slice needs a dedicated `wd.spec.*` note before implementation.
- [x] Define the first local request/result shapes in shared `core` and `runtime` for adding a single Knop-owned reference.
- [x] Define the exact first local CLI surface for the carried reference-catalog operation.
- [x] Add failing unit and integration tests for the `08` reference-catalog behavior.
- [x] Implement the next local or in-process reference-catalog path over shared `core` and `runtime`.
- [x] Add a black-box CLI acceptance test scoped by the settled `08-alice-bio-referenced` Accord manifest.
- [c] Draft or refine the thin public API example or contract fragment in `semantic-flow-framework` if this slice sharpens the public contract.
- [x] Update relevant overview/spec/framework notes as the slice settles.
