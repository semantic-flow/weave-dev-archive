root-designator-path-support

Please review [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-08_1133-root-designator-path-support]] and let me know if you're ready to begin implementation.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1154_38

I’m reviewing the task note in the context of the repo’s required guidance first. I’ll read the product vision, the general developer guidance, and the task note, then I’ll tell you whether the implementation scope is solid or where it still needs tightening.

The task note is specific enough to audit against the current code instead of treating it as a purely speculative design. I’m checking the existing designator parsing, path builders, and target selection surfaces now to see whether the note is implementable as written or still has hidden ambiguities.

I’ve confirmed the task note is aligned with the existing targeting note and CLI reference. I’m reading the concrete implementation seams now to check whether the note leaves any critical decision unstated, especially around inventory discovery, path joins, and user-facing root display.

The implementation seams are exactly where the task note says they are: normalization, target selection, inventory discovery, path joining, and page rendering. I’m checking a couple of helper functions now to see whether the task note has enough guidance for the root page/canonical-path edge cases, because that’s the one place where “root as empty string” tends to spill into rendering.

I’ve got enough context to judge the note now. I’m reading the CLI parser helpers once, because the note explicitly claims all designator-path CLI surfaces should accept `/`, and I want to verify whether that statement matches how the command layer is factored today.

The remaining question is not whether the note is actionable; it is whether it is narrow enough. I’m checking the `knop` and reference surfaces because the note currently includes them in scope, and those are the places where root support could unexpectedly sprawl if the seams are not already clean.

I’ve finished the review. I’m pulling exact line references for the seams that matter so I can give you a concrete readiness answer instead of a hand-wave.

I’ve got the implementation assessment. One last compliance pass: the repo guidance says the ontology summary is baseline context, so I’m skimming that before I give you the go/no-go answer.

Yes. The task note is ready enough to implement, and I do not see a blocking spec gap.

It lines up with the real code seams that currently prevent root support: shared designator validation rejects empty paths in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts#L8), mesh inventory discovery drops the root candidate in [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L32), `--target` parsing has no root sentinel normalization in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts#L736), root page paths would currently break `index.html` handling in [html.ts](../../src/core/weave/html.ts#L3), and user-facing identifier pages would render a blank label in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts#L20). The note is also right that this extends beyond shared targeting, because several single-designator commands still carry their own non-root validators in [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts#L151), [update.ts](../../src/core/payload/update.ts#L88), [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts#L130), and [add_reference.ts](../../src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L165).

The only implementation assumption I’d carry, not a blocker, is that persisted Knop metadata should also use `sflo:designatorPath ""` for root while all CLI and display surfaces render `/`. If that matches your intent, I’m ready to begin, and I’d start by centralizing root-aware path helpers before threading `/` normalization through CLI parsing and the command-specific seams.

# User_2026-04-08_1207_27

Should we factor out all the validators?

metadata presumably has the base set correctly, so in Turtle the root would be <>. If you needed to use a currie/prefix, it would look like "ex:"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1208_09

I’m checking one generator seam so I can answer the Turtle point against the current code rather than from memory.

Not all of them.

I’d factor out the shared `designatorPath` family, because that duplication is now the actual source of risk across [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts), [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts#L151), [update.ts](../../src/core/payload/update.ts#L88), [create.ts](../../src/core/knop/create.ts#L130), [add_reference.ts](../../src/core/knop/add_reference.ts#L165), and [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts#L173). That should become one shared normalizer plus a few thin helpers:
- CLI normalization: `/` -> `""`
- internal validation: allow root or disallow root depending on surface
- display formatting: `""` -> `/`
- root-aware path joins like `toKnopPath("") => "_knop"`

I would not spend this slice building a universal validation framework. `meshBase`, working-file paths, source handling, and reference-target-state paths have different semantics and error contracts; collapsing all of that now would create more churn than value.

On Turtle: yes, for the root identifier the clean spelling is `<>` when `@base` is set. That is better than a mesh-local prefix alias. Small correction, though: runtime does not currently rely on the Turtle `@base` directive to discover the mesh base. It reads the explicit `sflo:meshBase` literal from [_mesh/_meta/meta.ttl](../../src/runtime/mesh/metadata.ts#L27), while the generators also emit `@base` in [mesh/create.ts](../../src/core/mesh/create.ts#L65). So the shape I’d use is:
- resource IRI references for root: `<>`
- Knop literal path value: `sflo:designatorPath ""`
- keep explicit `sflo:meshBase` as-is
- do not introduce `ex:` for generated mesh-local identifiers in this slice

That is the factoring boundary I’d implement.

# User_2026-04-08_1210_09

OK, proceed with implementation

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1210_24

I’m starting implementation now. First pass is to introduce shared root-aware designator and path helpers, then thread them through CLI parsing, inventory discovery, and page rendering before I touch the higher-level command flows.

I’ve confirmed the command layer has separate entry points for every single-designator surface. I’m consolidating those through shared helpers rather than patching each one ad hoc, because otherwise root support will regress the next time a command adds its own validator.

I’ve reached the part that actually matters for correctness: inventory resolution and target matching both have root-specific failure modes, not just superficial path formatting. I’m fixing those together so `/,recursive=true` works semantically instead of merely parsing.

I’m editing the shared designator helper layer first. This is the right choke point: if root normalization and path joining are not centralized here, the rest of the patch becomes a pile of one-off exceptions.

I’m moving the core command planners onto the shared designator helper now. This is the piece that makes programmatic `designatorPath: ""` valid without teaching the CLI sentinel `/` to the core.

I’m in the large `core/weave` patch now. That file has the real blast radius because several carried slices still hardcode `${designatorPath}/…`; I’m converting those to root-aware joins instead of sprinkling root conditionals through the planner.

I’ve moved past the core planner and into the runtime inventory layer. Root support is not real until the runtime can resolve `<>`, `_knop`, and root-owned pages without treating empty mesh-relative paths as missing data.

The CLI patch is next. I’m normalizing `/` at the edge exactly once, then letting runtime/core see only the internal empty-string root form. That keeps the public spelling and internal contract cleanly separated.

I’ve reached the user-facing rendering pass. The remaining changes are mostly about not leaking the internal empty-string root representation back into pages and CLI output as blank labels or malformed relative links.

I’ve already pushed the shared root-path plumbing through the main command and runtime seams. I’m auditing the remaining weave generation paths now, then I’ll add tests and run the repo checks so we can see what still breaks.

The shared helpers are in place. I’m on the last code audit pass now, mainly around woven page generation and a few user-facing strings that still assume non-root designators.

I’ve reached the point where the remaining risk is correctness, not architecture. Next step is a compile/test pass so I can fix the actual breakpoints instead of guessing at them.

I have the test surfaces mapped. I’m adding root coverage in the smallest places that actually prove the behavior: helper/unit level, runtime inventory/rendering, and one end-to-end path through CLI targeting and single-designator commands.

There’s one real bug left from the audit: one runtime path loader still builds `/${...}` for root and would bypass the workspace join. I’m patching those remaining absolute-path leaks before I add the root tests.

I’m editing the last root-sensitive path joins now: one runtime loader, the extract summary string, and a few woven-page descriptions that would still render the root as blank text.

I’m adding the shared root test fixture now so the new coverage stays readable. After that I’ll layer the unit/runtime checks first, then the CLI cases.

The next pass is runtime-level root behavior for the remaining commands. I’m adding those where they buy us real protection against the root path regressing again, especially around file loading and target resolution.

The CLI layer is next. I’m using small black-box tests that prove `/` gets past parsing and lands on the right mesh-relative paths, rather than rechecking whole fixture trees for new root-only states we don’t already have manifests for.

The new root tests all compile. I’m running them in groups now, because the remaining failures should be behavioral rather than syntax or type issues.

The failing tests were useful. The implementation gap is smaller than it looked: root integrate only works from the same preconditions as any other first payload integration, and one inventory walker still didn’t recognize `<_knop>`. I’m fixing both the code and the tests to reflect the real precondition boundary.

The remaining failures are all the same shape: root payload integration succeeds, but the weave/version path still assumes a non-empty mesh subject key when it rewrites Turtle blocks. I’m fixing that in the mesh-inventory rewriter now.

The block matcher fix is in. I’m rerunning the root weave/version path and the black-box CLI cases now; if anything is still failing, it should be a concrete root-specific rewrite edge rather than a broad parser issue.

I found the last CLI bug. The shared optional designator-path resolver was treating normalized root `""` as “missing”, so `/` worked for required positional commands but disappeared for option-or-positional commands like `integrate` and `payload update`. I’m fixing that distinction now.

The code path is stable now. I’m doing the final repo work: update the docs where `/` was still documented as “reserved but unsupported”, then run format, lint, typecheck, and the full test task.

The docs only need a narrow update. I’m changing the CLI reference from “reserved” to “implemented”, and I’m marking the task note implementation checklist complete rather than rewriting its historical rationale.

Implemented root designator support end to end.

`/` now works as the CLI root sentinel across shared targeting and single-designator commands in [run.ts](../../src/cli/run.ts), normalizing to internal `""` through shared helpers in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts). Root-owned paths now render correctly as `_knop`, `_history001`, and `index.html` rather than gaining leading slashes, and root display surfaces render `/` in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts) and the weave planners in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts). Inventory discovery and runtime loading now include a root Knop at `_knop` in [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts).

I also updated the CLI and overview notes in [[wu.cli-reference]], [[wd.codebase-overview]], and checked off the task note in [[wa.completed.2026.2026-04-08_1133-root-designator-path-support]]. Coverage now includes unit, runtime, integration, and black-box CLI tests for exact and recursive root targeting plus root command flows.

Verification: `deno task ci` passed.

Please review Coderabbit 1 & 2 in [[wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review]] 

For each item, add a markdown checkbox. Those that are clearly not worth doing, mark with [c].

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1340_12

I’m opening the review note now to map Coderabbit items 1 and 2, then I’ll mark each item with a checkbox and use `[c]` where the recommendation is clearly not worth taking.

I’m checking the referenced files now so the checkboxes reflect the current state rather than the review text alone. The duplicate Coderabbit item is likely a cancel candidate, but I want to confirm the other ones against the code first.

I’ve verified the current state. I’m updating the review note now: real open items get `[ ]`, the duplicate and low-value refactor nit get `[c]`.

Updated [[wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review]] with checkboxes for each Coderabbit 1 and 2 item.

I marked the duplicate `runtime/weave` finding and the `runCliCommand` refactor nit as `[c]`. The remaining items stayed `[ ]` because they still look valid against the current code and docs.

# User_2026-04-08_1406_20

I added another round of coderabbit reviews, and some comments from the new source, Entelligence. Please review in the same manner, and then begin the obvious high-value fixes.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1406_32

I’m re-reading the review note first to classify the new Coderabbit and Entelligence items against the current code, then I’ll mark them with checkboxes and start on the ones that are clearly worth fixing now.

I’ve got the new items. I’m checking the specific code paths now because several of the Entelligence claims conflict with the fact that the repo currently passes `deno task ci`, so some of those are almost certainly stale or incorrect rather than actionable.

# User_2026-04-08_1408_00

If it helps, I should be logged in to the github CLI now, you can  maybe review the PR directly: https://github.com/semantic-flow/weave/pull/10

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_1408_08

I’m pulling the PR review context directly now so I can reconcile the note against the actual unresolved comments, not just the copied excerpts. I’m using the GitHub workflow for this pass.

Review note and PR comments are the priority, then I’ll patch the obvious correctness issues rather than spending time on stylistic nits. I’m pulling the current note and the affected code paths together so I can classify the new review items and make the first round of fixes in one pass.

The new review round has a few real correctness issues mixed into a lot of stale or low-value noise. I’m classifying the note now, then I’ll patch the failures that can actually change behavior: dropped requested targets, CLI path validation bypass, root-child matching, root extract/weave edge cases, and the root page link rendering bug.

I’ve confirmed the main correctness issues. Next I’m opening the nearest tests so I can patch behavior and its regressions together instead of making isolated fixes.

There’s also a small but real runtime input-hardening fix in `executeWeave`: its shared-target adapter can still throw raw JS errors before version-target normalization runs. I’m likely folding that in because it’s cheap and keeps `validate`/`generate` aligned with `version`.

I’ve got enough context to patch now. The first edit batch will update the review note checkboxes and land the core/runtime fixes together, then I’ll add the regression tests that pin each behavior.

I’m updating the review note first so the keep/fix/drop calls are explicit in the repo, then I’ll mark off the ones that actually get fixed once the test pass is done.

I’m in the main edit pass now. This patch is the behavior change itself: tighter CLI normalization, stricter requested-target planning, root-safe extracted-weave validation, and the pinned-root page rendering fix.

I’ve landed the main runtime/core edits. I’m cleaning up the small guidance doc issue from the review as well, then I’ll run the targeted tests to catch any expectation drift before the full CI pass.

I’ve finished the edit pass and I’m on verification now. First I’m running the touched unit/integration/e2e files directly so any failures point to the new changes instead of the entire suite noise.

The first targeted run exposed two expectation mismatches, not behavioral failures: the pinned-link tests were still asserting old anchor text, and I overcounted the relative depth for root links. I’m fixing those expectations, then I’ll rerun the same set with the env permission the suite needs.

The focused tests are mostly green now. I’m waiting on the longer integration/e2e cases to finish, then I’ll move to the full formatter/lint/CI pass and update the review note statuses for the fixes that landed.

The recursive-target failure is a semantic mismatch, not a regression in the core exact-target fix: recursive subtree requests should still succeed when only descendants are weaveable. I’m narrowing that guard to exact targets and then fixing the remaining root-source extract shape assumption that still expects duplicated root/source facts.

The remaining failure is just in the synthetic root-source test setup. The code path is fine; the workspace I built was too minimal for `integrate`’s current carried-shape assumptions. I’m switching that test to a fixture state that already satisfies those assumptions without introducing unrelated extracted-shape noise.

The focused regressions are green. I’m doing the repo-level hygiene pass now: formatter first, then the full CI task, and after that I’ll flip the corresponding review note items from open to done.

The code and full CI pass are done. I’m updating the review note statuses now so the file reflects what was actually fixed versus what was intentionally canceled.

Implemented the high-value review fixes and updated the review tracker in [[wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review]]. The main behavior changes are in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts), [extract.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract.ts), [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts), and [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts).

The fixes landed are: shared CLI path normalization now uses the same safe-path validation as the rest of the system; exact requested targets now fail closed when they are not currently weaveable, while recursive subtree targets still succeed when descendants are weaveable; `executeWeave` now validates forwarded shared targets before `validate`/`generate`; root-sourced extracted flows no longer break on collapsed root/source knop assumptions; and pinned root reference links now display `/` instead of a relative path. I also fixed the guidance note in [[wd.general-guidance]] to remove the hard-coded `updated` field and align the `wd.task.*` rename policy with repo instructions.

Verification: `deno task ci` passed.

Suggested commit message:

# User_2026-04-08_2215_48

Anything you wish you could change or do-over. Any post-fix discussion about potential future issues, traps, next steps?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2216_19

A few.

**Do-Over**
I’d probably move the new “requested target coverage” rule out of [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts) and into a shared targeting seam in [targeting.ts](../../src/core/targeting.ts). The current behavior is right, but the exact-vs-recursive policy now lives in the runtime layer, which makes it easier to drift later.

I’d also prefer a proper reusable root-source extract fixture/helper instead of the synthetic Turtle blocks now living in [extract_test.ts](../../src/core/extract/extract_test.ts) and [weave_test.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave_test.ts). The tests are good, but they are a little hand-built and therefore brittle.

**Watchlist**
- Root regressions will come back any time someone hand-concatenates paths instead of using helpers in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts). The danger pattern is any new `${designatorPath}/...` or prefix check that forgets `""` is valid.
- The new target rule is intentionally asymmetric: exact targets must themselves be weaveable, but recursive targets only need at least one weaveable match below them. That’s correct, but it’s subtle. Someone cleaning up [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts) could easily “simplify” it back into a bug.
- `executeWeave` still does `validate -> version -> generate` as separate passes in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts). It’s fine now, but any future target-shape expansion is a place where normalization or semantics can diverge again.
- Extracted-weave support is still narrow and domain-shaped in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts). The root fixes are real, but the page/render path still assumes specific `alice`/`bio` semantics and FOAF/schema fields. If extract broadens beyond the current slice, that is the next pressure point.

**Next Steps**
- Pull the exact/recursive target-coverage logic into [targeting.ts](../../src/core/targeting.ts) and test it there.
- Add a `tests/support` helper for “root payload as extracted source” instead of duplicating synthetic setup.
- Grep for raw designator-path string joins and convert the remaining ones to shared helpers before another root-path bug sneaks in.
- Keep skipping the perf-refactor and test-helper-dedup review nits for now; they’re still not the right tradeoff.

# User_2026-04-08_2226_32

Any opportunities to use Accord to generate new fixtures and specs around the empty mesh root? Maybe we keep going in the "mesh-alice-bio" series, 14-add-root-identifier. 

Any opportunity to refactor weave.ts is welcome by me, that thing is a beast. I'm surprise you didn't bring up refactoring.

Maybe add a code comment about target rule asymmetry. 

Explain "executeWeave still does validate -> version -> generate as separate passes in weave.ts. It’s fine now, but any future target-shape expansion is a place where normalization or semantics can diverge again."

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2226_47

I’m checking the current Accord/fixture shape and the `weave.ts` seams before I answer, and I’ll add the target-rule comment while I’m in there. The refactor discussion is worth grounding in the actual manifest flow and current file structure rather than hand-waving.

I found the current conformance ladder and the two main seams I’d refactor. I’m adding the asymmetry comment now so that rule is documented in code, then I’ll lay out the Accord/fixture/spec opportunities and the `validate -> version -> generate` concern concretely.

I added the asymmetry comment in the runtime seam so the next cleanup doesn’t “simplify” that rule away accidentally. I’m just running the formatter on that file, then I’ll answer the design questions directly.

**Accord**
Yes, but with one correction: Accord is the acceptance layer, not the fixture generator. The new refs still have to exist in the `mesh-alice-bio` fixture repo, and the manifests in [conformance README](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/semantic-flow-framework/examples/alice-bio/conformance/README.md) just describe the transitions between them.

I would not use `14-add-root-identifier` if the goal is the “empty mesh root”. In the current ladder, `14-*` would come after `13-bob-extracted-woven`, so that state is no longer empty and root is no longer isolated. Two better options:
- Keep the linear Alice/Bio ladder and name the next real transitions by operation/state, e.g. `14-root-integrated` then `15-root-woven`. That gives you root coverage, but not “empty mesh root”.
- If you specifically want root behavior in isolation, start a separate mini-ladder from an early mesh state instead of overloading the late Alice/Bio story. That is the cleaner choice.

The best Accord opportunities around root are:
- exact root integrate/version/generate/weave
- recursive root targeting over mixed settled and pending descendants
- root as a reference target
- root as an extract source
- invariants that root-owned support artifacts stay mesh-relative: `_knop`, `_history001`, `index.html`

I’d also add a behavior note like `wd.spec.root-targeting` or `wd.spec.root-lifecycle` and let the Accord manifests be the concrete acceptance layer for the fixture transitions.

**Refactor**
Yes, `weave.ts` should be refactored. I did not push it in the review-fix turn because the PR was already carrying correctness churn, and a structural refactor would have made blame and review much noisier. But at this point it is warranted: [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts) is 1353 lines, and [src/core/weave/weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts) is 4304.

The highest-value first cuts are:
- pull request normalization and target adaptation out of [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L375](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L375)
- pull staged planning and candidate loading out of [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L416](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L416)
- split per-slice planning/assertion logic out of [src/core/weave/weave.ts#L189](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L189)
- eventually move the domain-specific extracted-page builders out of the core planner file

I also added the asymmetry comment in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L559](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L559).

**What I Meant**
`executeWeave` in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L222](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L222) is currently an orchestration wrapper around three public commands:
- `executeValidate`
- `executeVersion`
- `executeGenerate`

That means target handling is still happening in three places:
- `validate` normalizes shared target fields
- `version` normalizes full version targets
- `generate` normalizes shared target fields again
- `executeWeave` bridges them with `toSharedTargetRequest` in [src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L375](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L375)

Today that is okay because the shared shape is small: basically `designatorPath` and `recursive`, and I hardened the bridge so it reuses version-target normalization before stripping version-only fields.

The trap is future expansion. If you later add a new target option and teach `version` about it but forget to teach `validate` or `generate`, then `executeWeave` can silently run the three phases against different target semantics. The bad class of bug is:
- `version` mutates target set A
- `generate` renders target set B
- `validate` reports on target set C

Nothing is wrong today; the design just has multiple normalization seams that can drift. The long-term fix is a single canonical “prepared weave request” or a single shared target-resolution pass that all three phases consume.

If you want, next I’d either draft the root Accord/spec plan or start the first `weave.ts` extraction pass.

# User_2026-04-08_2233_45

we need a way to customize an referents ( "like alice/") main page (alice/index.html) without making alice/_knop a payload knop. i.e. without alice representing a file.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2233_57

I’m checking how identifier pages are produced today and where `alice/index.html` is currently special-cased, because the answer depends on whether you want a new artifact type, a generated view over existing RDF, or a template override.

Yes. This should be a separate artifact, not a payload.

Right now the code already shows the pressure point: generic identifier pages come from [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts), but `alice/index.html` is also being custom-built by special-case HTML in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts). That is a sign the model wants an explicit “identifier page source” concept rather than more bespoke exceptions.

The clean model is:

- `alice` stays an identifier, not a working file.
- `alice/_knop` optionally owns a page-source artifact.
- `alice/index.html` remains a generated/public page.
- `generate` or `weave` renders that page from the page source when present, otherwise falls back to the generic identifier page.

I would not make `alice/index.html` itself the editable source, and I would not make `alice` a payload artifact just to get a custom page. Both would blur “identifier” and “document” in a way that will keep leaking into the rest of the model.

The most plausible first implementation is exactly the roadmap item in [[roadmap]]: a knop-owned HTML-or-Markdown DigitalArtifact that can be chromed or served as-is. In practice that probably means something like a knop support artifact under `alice/_knop/_page` or `_presentation`, plus a generate-time renderer that materializes `alice/index.html`.

On Accord: yes, this is a good fit, but I would not call it `14-add-root-identifier`. That mixes two concerns. For the Alice/Bio ladder, I’d rather do something like:
- `14-alice-page-customized`
- `15-alice-page-customized-woven`

And for empty-root behavior, I’d use a separate ladder or a branch from an early mesh state. Root isolation and referent-page customization are both worth specs, but they are not the same story.

This is also a good excuse to refactor `weave.ts`. The bad current split is:
- page planning/data lives partly in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts)
- page rendering lives partly in [pages.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/pages.ts)
- and some page HTML is still hardcoded in the core planner

For this feature, I’d want:
- core planner emits page models only
- runtime renderer owns all HTML rendering
- page-source resolution is its own seam
- no more `alice`-specific HTML builders in the core weave planner

On the `validate -> version -> generate` point: [executeWeave](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L222) currently orchestrates those as three separate public operations, and bridges them with [toSharedTargetRequest](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L375) and [prepareVersionExecution](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L416). That is fine while target semantics are tiny. But if you add page-specific request fields later, one phase can easily honor them while another silently drops them. That is the drift risk. A future refactor should normalize the weave request once and pass one prepared execution object through all three phases.

I also added the asymmetry comment in [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts#L559).

If you want, next I can turn this into a concrete task/spec note and propose the minimal artifact shape for a knop-owned customizable identifier page.

# User_2026-04-08_2239_38

- yes on _knop/_page. But we should be able to target independent identifiers as the source, so they can take advantage of the independent versioning of a fully integrated DigitalArtifact? What do you think? That could bring in stuff from outside the mesh.

- add code comments for future potential pitfalls
- update [[roadmap]] with a prioritized list of all the things we've discussed including refactorings that are worth doing. maybe classify things on both [importance] and [how-soon] (i.e., sensible sequencing)

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2239_52

I’m turning the design discussion into concrete repo changes now: a few defensive comments in the risky seams, and a real prioritized roadmap entry list that captures the customization model, Accord/spec work, and the refactors. After that I’ll give you my take on external/independent page sources.

I’m patching two more defensive comments into the code: one on root mesh-relative path behavior, one on the `executeWeave` target-bridging seam. Then I’ll rewrite the roadmap into an ordered list with explicit `importance` and `how-soon` tags.

The roadmap rewrite is in place with explicit `importance` and `how-soon` tags. I’m just formatting the touched TypeScript files now, then I’ll answer the independent page-source design point directly.

Yes, but with one important constraint: `alice/_knop/_page` should be the local authoritative descriptor, not necessarily the content itself.

That means I’d support three modes behind the same knop-owned page artifact:
- local authored page source stored under `alice/_knop/_page/...`
- referenced in-mesh DigitalArtifact identifier
- referenced extra-mesh DigitalArtifact identifier/IRI

The reason to keep `_knop/_page` authoritative is that otherwise `alice/index.html` starts depending directly on arbitrary remote or cross-mesh current state, which is a bad default. The local `_page` artifact should say:
- what the source is
- whether it is pinned to a historical state or allowed to follow current
- how it is rendered or chromed
- what cache or offline policy applies

My bias is:
- in-mesh source by identifier: yes
- extra-mesh source: yes, but only with explicit policy
- default to pinned state, not floating current state
- `alice/index.html` remains generated output, never the canonical editable source

The main trap if you allow external/current sources too casually is nondeterminism: two `generate` runs can produce different public pages without any local workspace change. That is why I’d make “follow current external state” an explicit opt-in, probably not the default.

I added defensive comments in [designator_segments.ts](../../src/core/designator_segments.ts) and [weave.ts](../../src/runtime/weave/weave.ts), and I rewrote [[roadmap]] into a prioritized queue with both `importance` and `how-soon`. The top items now are the `weave.ts` refactors, unified target preparation, `_knop/_page`, referenced page sources, and the security/resolution policy for extra-mesh sources.

I did not rerun full CI after this last step because these were comment/doc changes only; I did run `deno fmt` on the touched TypeScript files.

# User_2026-04-08_2241_47

Let's add a "coding standards" section to [dev.general-guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/documentation/dev.general-guidance.md)if there isn't something somewhere else that notes our take on in-code comments: "best used sparingly, but helpful when some potential future change might get tripped up with an unexpected or unusual subtlety"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2242_02

I’m checking the target note and the nearby guidance notes first so I don’t add a duplicate rule in the wrong place. If the same guidance already exists somewhere more current, I’ll point to that instead of silently duplicating it.

There is already a `## Coding Standards` section in that note, plus a `### Code Comments` subsection. I’m adding the comment-guidance there rather than creating a second competing section.

I found that the note already had both `## Coding Standards` and `### Code Comments`, so I added the guidance there instead of creating a duplicate section in [dev.general-guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo/documentation/dev.general-guidance.md).

The new bullet says comments should be used sparingly, but are valuable when a future change could miss an unusual constraint, subtle invariant, or other non-obvious behavior. No formatter or tests were needed for this markdown-only change.

# User_2026-04-08_2245_19

_knop/_page can be the default, but we are pretty safe referencing other in-mesh artifacts, and if you really want to use something external without ingesting it, you should probably be able to take that risk. Might be some security issues there. We could leave network (what-do-we-call-it, "resourcePageSource"? It feels like it'll need its own knop to take advantage of other weave publishing feature/workflows?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2245_58

Yes, that direction makes sense.

I’d model it as:

- `alice/_knop/_page` is the local page-definition artifact for `alice/index.html`
- that artifact may contain local source content directly
- or it may point at a source via something like `sflo:resourcePageSource`
- if you want pinning, add `sflo:resourcePageSourceState`

So `_knop/_page` stays the local authoritative control point, while the actual source can be:
- local inline/local file content
- another in-mesh artifact identifier
- an external identifier/IRI

I would not make `_knop/_page` itself “its own knop”. If the source deserves independent versioning, publication, references, or normal weave workflows, make that source a separate first-class identifier elsewhere in the mesh, and let `_knop/_page` reference it. That keeps the model clean:
- page definition/config lives under the referent’s knop
- reusable page content can still be a full mesh resource with its own knop
- no weird “support artifact with another support artifact stack” under `_knop`

On naming, `resourcePageSource` is a good property name, but probably not a good artifact name. The artifact is doing more than just naming a source. I’d call the artifact something like:
- `ResourcePageDefinition`
- or `ResourcePageSpec`

and let it carry fields like:
- `sflo:resourcePageSource`
- `sflo:resourcePageSourceState`
- render mode
- chrome policy
- maybe trust/fetch policy

For external sources: yes, allow it, but make it explicit and fail-closed by default. The real risks are:
- SSRF / arbitrary fetches
- nondeterministic output if it follows current remote state
- hostile HTML or script content
- privacy leaks from embeds/subresources
- caching/content-type ambiguity

So my preference is:
- in-mesh source references: normal and safe
- external source references: opt-in, probably `https` only at first
- pinned external state preferred over “follow current”
- no automatic ingestion unless the user asks for ingestion

I also think this belongs on the roadmap exactly as “local `_knop/_page` definition artifact, optionally referencing independently versioned in-mesh or explicit external sources.”

If you want, I can turn this into a concrete task/spec note with a proposed Turtle shape.

# User_2026-04-08_2248_22

We need a way to specify "use only" vs "prefer" (maybe acceptOtherVersions, acceptLowerVersions, acceptHigherVersions), ie. allow people for flexibility that just pinning a single version or a floating version. Too complicated?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2248_49

Not too complicated in principle, but I would not encode it as three booleans.

`acceptOtherVersions`, `acceptLowerVersions`, `acceptHigherVersions` gets messy fast:
- contradictory combinations
- unclear defaults
- assumes “lower/higher” is meaningful everywhere
- says nothing about whether the preference is hard or soft

The cleaner model is:

- `resourcePageSource`: what artifact/identifier to use
- `resourcePageSourceState`: the preferred or required state
- `resourcePageSourceMode`: `exact` | `prefer` | `current`
- `resourcePageSourceFallback`: `none` | `earlier-same-history` | `later-same-history` | `any-same-history`

That gives you the important distinction:
- `exact` means “use only this state”
- `prefer` means “try this state, but fall back according to policy”
- `current` means “follow the current state”

I would also keep fallback limited to the same history at first. “Lower/higher” only really makes sense when there is a stable ordering inside one artifact history. Once you cross histories, meshes, or external systems, the semantics get fuzzy.

So my v1 shape would be:
- exact pinned
- follow current
- prefer pinned, fallback earlier in same history

That covers most real use without turning resolution into a mini package manager.

For external sources, I’d be stricter:
- `exact` and maybe `current`
- no “lower/higher” fallback until there is an explicit external version adapter model
- probably an explicit unsafe/allow-network flag somewhere in the local `_knop/_page` definition

So: the capability is worth having, but model it as `mode + fallback policy`, not as a bag of booleans.

If you want, I can draft a concrete RDF shape for `ResourcePageDefinition` with those properties.

# User_2026-04-08_2255_17

Different parts of the page could correspond to different digital artifacts. Do we mix "control" and "content" into a single RDF file?  Can we put as much static content into _page/ as we want and reference it using relative paths? I used to have an optional-anywhere resource folder, essentially contents unmanaged.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2255_49

Yes, but I would keep a strong boundary:

- RDF in `_knop/_page` should primarily be the control plane
- actual substantial content should usually live in referenced files or artifacts

So: do not turn one RDF file into a CMS blob unless the content is small.

A good model is:

```text
alice/_knop/_page/
  page.ttl
  intro.md
  sidebar.html
  _assets/
    portrait.jpg
    theme.css
```

Where `page.ttl` says things like:
- what regions/slots exist
- what source each region uses
- whether each source is local, in-mesh, or external
- render/chrome policy
- version-selection policy

Then each part can come from:
- a sibling file in `_page/`
- another in-mesh DigitalArtifact identifier
- an external DigitalArtifact/IRI if explicitly allowed

So yes, different parts of the page can correspond to different DigitalArtifacts. That is probably the right design.

On mixing control and content in one RDF file:
- fine for small literals: title, summary, nav label, maybe a short intro
- not fine for large prose, templates, or multiple page regions
- RDF should be the manifest, not the whole document store

On “can we put as much static content into `_page/` as we want and reference it using relative paths?”:
- yes, I think that is reasonable
- relative paths are actually a good fit here
- but I would scope it to `_knop/_page/` rather than revive an optional-anywhere resource folder

I would avoid “unmanaged anywhere” and instead allow a bounded local page bundle:
- `_knop/_page/` for local page content
- `_knop/_page/_assets/` for verbatim static files

That gives you most of the flexibility without losing publication/security boundaries.

The trap with a fully unmanaged folder is that it becomes unclear:
- what is actually part of the published page bundle
- what should be copied or versioned
- what should be ignored
- what remote or local file references are allowed

So I’d define `_page/` semantics explicitly:
- files under `_page/` may be referenced by relative path from `page.ttl`
- referenced files are part of the page bundle
- unreferenced files are ignored by default, or at least not guaranteed to publish
- external references require explicit opt-in
- in-mesh artifact references are safe and first-class

The clean mental model is:

- `page.ttl`: page definition
- local sibling files: bundled page content
- referenced DigitalArtifacts: reusable content sources
- generated `alice/index.html`: public output

That keeps “control” and “content” separate without making the content story awkward.

If you want, I can draft a concrete `_page/page.ttl` shape next, including multi-region composition and local relative-path sources.

# User_2026-04-08_2257_48

have you looked at proposed ResourcePage templating ideas? see the outdated /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/old/sflo-config-ontology.jsonld - we're kinda talking more about content than templating, but theres some grey areas and probably are part of the same process and might have some functional needs in common.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2257_56

I’m checking that old config ontology directly and pulling just the ResourcePage/template-related bits. Then I’ll map what it already covers against the `_knop/_page` content-definition model we’ve been sketching.

Yes. I looked at [sflo-config-ontology.jsonld](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/old/sflo-config-ontology.jsonld), and it is relevant.

What it already had, conceptually:
- `TemplateMappingSet` and `TemplateMapping`
- `innerTemplate`, `outerTemplate`, `stylesheet`
- target-selection rules like class regex / slug regex
- `mappingPriority`
- `generateResourcePages`

So that old design was mostly about template selection and chrome policy, not about authored page content. It answers questions like:
- which shell/template should a page use?
- which stylesheet should apply?
- when multiple mappings match, which one wins?

What we’re discussing now is a different but adjacent layer:
- where the page’s actual content comes from
- whether different page regions come from different artifacts
- whether sources are local, in-mesh, or external
- how version selection / fallback works

So I think these are part of the same overall pipeline, but not the same artifact.

The clean split is:

1. Page definition / content composition
- lives under something like `alice/_knop/_page/page.ttl`
- says what regions exist and what each region’s source is
- can reference local bundle files, in-mesh artifacts, or explicit external sources

2. Template / chrome policy
- can be mesh-level or knop-level config
- picks outer template, inner template, stylesheet, chrome mode, etc.
- this is where the old `TemplateMapping` ideas fit best

3. Generate-time page plan
- resolves content sources
- resolves template/chrome
- produces the final `alice/index.html`

So I would not collapse content composition and template mapping into one thing, but I also would not treat them as unrelated. They should meet in the page-generation process.

What from the old design I would keep:
- the distinction between content and outer/inner template is good
- stylesheet as a first-class artifact is good
- priority-based mapping is plausible
- mesh/knop config controlling page generation is plausible

What I would probably not keep as-is:
- regex-based target matching as the main selection mechanism
- a purely template-centric model with no first-class page-definition artifact
- anything that makes authored page content live only in config

The likely common functional needs are:
- slot/region naming
- render mode per source
- chrome inclusion or exclusion
- version/state selection
- conflict resolution / precedence
- external fetch policy and trust boundaries

So my current recommendation is:

- `_knop/_page` becomes the authored page-definition/content-control artifact
- old-style template mapping concepts get revived as config/theming policy
- page generation merges both

That is also why I think `resourcePageSource` is not enough by itself. You’ll probably want:
- per-region content sources in `_page`
- plus separate template/chrome selection above or beside it

If you want, next I can draft the layered model explicitly:
- `ResourcePageDefinition`
- `ResourcePageRegion`
- `resourcePageSource`
- `outerTemplate` / `innerTemplate` / `stylesheet`
- and where each one should live.

# User_2026-04-08_2258_47

for conversational examples see:  /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.conv.2025-12-14-template-iri-vs-url.md through /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.conv.2026.2026-01-30-artifact-identity-and-realizability.md

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2259_00

I’m pulling the conversation notes in that range and extracting the modeling themes that matter for `_knop/_page`, content sources, and templating. Then I’ll map them back onto the design split we were discussing.

I’ve got the note range. I’m narrowing to the template/artifact/resource-page threads inside it so I can pull out the parts that actually constrain the `_knop/_page` design rather than the unrelated namespace discussions.

I’m pulling the guidance notes plus the specific conversation range so I can map those older template/artifact discussions onto the `_knop/_page` model instead of guessing from memory.

The old notes are consistent so far: they keep pushing toward first-class artifact identities and away from URL-only config, which is the right pressure for `_knop/_page`. I’m checking the intermediate template-mapping notes now to separate “content composition” from “chrome/template selection.”

I’ve got the pattern now. One important caveat before I summarize it back: those old notes are useful, but some of their terminology assumes an older `Artifact`/`NonArtifact` split, so I’m checking that against the current ontology before carrying anything forward.

The old template notes are useful, but they also confirm a second trap: if we let templates own too much navigation/search logic, we end up smuggling an app runtime into “static” resource pages. I’m checking the current ontology path directly so I can call out where the old Artifact/NonArtifact framing no longer matches.

I reviewed that span. The useful parts are mostly in [[sflo.conv.2025-12-14-template-iri-vs-url#L21]], [[sflo.conv.2025-12-22-template-mapping-review#L87]], [[sflo.conv.2025-12-23-template-design-refinement#L76]], and [[sflo.conv.2026.2026-01-30-artifact-identity-and-realizability]].

The main carry-forward points are:

- Treat template/page sources as first-class referenced things, not raw URL strings. That strongly supports `_knop/_page` as a local definition artifact whose fields point at IRIs or local relative resources, rather than a bag of literal paths.
- Keep conceptual identity separate from concrete bytes. That supports “page definition here, actual content possibly elsewhere” and “referenced in-mesh artifact with its own history” without forcing the referent itself to become a payload file.
- Keep templates dumb. The renderer should compute breadcrumbs, nav slices, and other derived structures; templates should render them. That argues against letting `_page` devolve into an app/runtime config blob.
- Do not copy the old regex-heavy `TemplateMappingSet` ideas directly. They look brittle and too monolithic for override/merge semantics.

One important mismatch: those old notes assume an older `Artifact`/`NonArtifact` worldview. The current ontology instead says `ResourcePage` is a `LocatedFile` and `hasResourcePage` is open to any resource in [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl#L191). So I’d borrow the modeling pressure, not the old vocabulary.

Net result: I think the right current design is still:
- `_knop/_page/` as a local page-definition bundle
- small RDF manifest as control plane
- large/static content in sibling files or referenced artifacts
- optional references to other in-mesh DigitalArtifacts, and explicit external IRIs if allowed
- template/chrome policy as a separate adjacent layer, not the same thing as content composition

That old conversation set makes me more confident in that split, not less. If you want, I can draft the minimal `_page/page.ttl` shape next.

# User_2026-04-08_2304_03

Another round, "coderabbit 4"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2304_12

I’m checking the new `Coderabbit 4` section in the review note and comparing it to the current code before I mark anything.

I’ve got two items to verify: one is just Dendron frontmatter churn in the review note, the other is whether `executeWeave` can still smuggle version-only target fields through `toSharedTargetRequest`. I’m reading that normalization path directly before I mark it.

`toSharedTargetRequest` still normalizes through the version-target parser and then drops `historySegment` / `stateSegment` on the floor. I’m checking whether that’s just harmless bridge reuse or whether it creates a real semantic gap worth fixing.

`weave` already has explicit black-box coverage for payload naming flags, so I’m treating that second review comment with suspicion rather than assuming it’s a bug. I’m checking the tests that pin that behavior before I mark it canceled.

I’ve verified both Coderabbit 4 items against the current behavior. Neither looks like a fix worth taking, so I’m marking both canceled rather than leaving them ambiguous.

Updated [[wd.review.2026-04-08-targeting-review]] for `Coderabbit 4`.

I marked both items `[c]`:
- the frontmatter `updated` note is not worth acting on for a normal Dendron note
- the `toSharedTargetRequest` comment is pushing against intended behavior, since `weave` intentionally supports payload naming flags and already has coverage for that path in [weave_cli_test.ts](../../tests/e2e/weave_cli_test.ts#L233) and [weave_test.ts](../../tests/integration/weave_test.ts#L239)

No tests were needed for this review-note-only change.

# User_2026-04-08_2312_52

each resourcePageSource should have it's own state and mode? and maybe "accept" instead of prefer" . But I hear you on package management. Maybe RDF already has a best practice or dedicated ontology we should re-use (literally or conceptually).

So _assets are only Knop level/ahistorical? That's fine. If you want versioned assets, you can point a new PayloadArtifact. 

Update [[roadmap]] and dredge this conversation while it's still fresh for anything that should go into task notes that correspond to the roadmap so we've capture our most valuable insights into future work.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2313_02

I’m pulling the current roadmap and nearby task notes first, then I’ll fold the `_knop/_page`, source-mode, asset-boundary, and `weave.ts` refactor decisions into the roadmap and the most relevant future task notes while the modeling discussion is still fresh.

I found there aren’t any task notes yet for the two highest-value future slices we’ve been discussing: `_knop/_page` page-definition work and the `executeWeave` refactor/unified target-preparation work. I’m pulling the existing task-note shape so I can add those rather than letting the roadmap carry all the detail by itself.

I’ve got the shape. I’m going to add two concrete future task notes so the roadmap points at something actionable instead of just carrying design conclusions in prose: one for `_knop/_page` and page-source modeling, one for `executeWeave`/target-preparation refactoring.

I’m editing the docs now: roadmap first, then two future task notes so the page-model and weave-refactor discussions are captured as concrete work items rather than just chat history.

I’ve captured the policy shape, but I want the page-source note to name the reuse surface more concretely while it’s still fresh: specific DCAT / PROV / Dublin Core terms, not just “some RDF best practice later.”

Yes: each `resourcePageSource` should own its own state and mode. I captured that as a per-source rule, not a page-global one, and I switched the working language from `prefer` to `accept` in the future-work note. I also captured the `_page/_assets` boundary as local and ahistorical: if an asset needs its own history or reuse story, it should be a separate payload artifact referenced from the page definition.

I updated [[roadmap]] and added two task notes so the design conclusions are no longer just in chat:
- [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-08_1545-resource-page-definition-and-sources]]
- [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-08_1615-weave-orchestration-refactor]]

The page-definition note now captures the highest-value modeling points from this discussion: `_knop/_page` as the local authoritative bundle, per-region/per-source selection policy, `_page/_assets` as bundle-only, in-mesh sources as first-class, extra-mesh sources as explicit fail-closed opt-ins, and template/chrome policy kept separate from content composition. I also named the likely standards reuse surface more concretely: [DCAT 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) for distributions/access/download, [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) for revision relations, and [DCMI Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) for version relations. I did not find a clean off-the-shelf RDF vocabulary for the exact `state + mode + fallback` semantics, so that part is still scoped as a small local vocabulary.

No tests run; this was documentation-only.

# User_2026-04-08_2317_04

if we could make the page elements recursive/holonic islands that might be fun. There must be existing public art around how to describe and composed a page. Maybe we can translate Vue to RDF? Hah, just kidding. 

Do we capture _assets/ content in KnopInventory?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2317_10

I’m checking the current inventory behavior directly so I can answer the `_assets` question from code rather than by inference, and then I’ll tie that back to the “holonic page islands” idea.

Yes, “holonic islands” could be good, but I would keep that as a second-phase shape, not the first implementation.

A sane progression is:
- first: `_knop/_page/page.ttl` describes a page plus named regions
- next: a region can itself point at another page-definition-like node or artifact
- later: that becomes recursive composition if it proves useful

That gets you the fun composability without starting by inventing RDF-Vue. If you start with fully recursive component trees immediately, you risk turning page composition into a framework problem before the basic source/state/policy model is stable.

On `_assets`: currently, no, not in any general way.

The current KnopInventory shape only records governed artifact/file surfaces like:
- payload working file
- knop `_meta`
- knop `_inventory`
- reference catalog when present

You can see that in the inventory writers in [integrate.ts](../../src/core/integrate/integrate.ts#L211) and the woven inventory renderers in [weave.ts](../../src/core/weave/weave.ts#L2822). The runtime inventory reader is similarly looking for known relations like `hasWorkingLocatedFile`, payload artifact state, and reference catalogs, not arbitrary bundle files, in [inventory.ts](../../src/runtime/mesh/inventory.ts#L36).

So if we add `_knop/_page/_assets`, my recommendation is:
- do not put every `_assets` file into KnopInventory by default
- let the page-definition manifest reference local asset files by relative path
- only promote something into inventory when it is a first-class governed artifact/facet, not just bundled page support content

That matches the boundary we just captured in [[roadmap]] and [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-08_1545-resource-page-definition-and-sources]]: `_page/_assets` is local and ahistorical; if an asset needs versioning, reuse, or publication identity, make it a separate payload artifact and reference it.

The trap to avoid is letting KnopInventory degrade into “filesystem manifest of everything under `_knop`.” That would make it noisier and semantically weaker.

# User_2026-04-08_2325_50

You might want to record some metadata about _assets so let's bring it into the ontology as AssetFolder or something.

Also, we'll need ontology updates (or a next-gen config ontology bourne out of previous good ideas). That might have to be our highest priority? Ontology changes for a change?

Update our [[roadmap]] and any of the related task tickets

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2326_06

I’m updating the planning docs to pull ontology/config modeling in front of runtime work, and I’m going to capture the `_assets` metadata idea with a tighter name than plain `AssetFolder` so it doesn’t accidentally imply “inventory every file under here.”

The main decision is sequence, not just content: I’m going to move ontology/config modeling ahead of implementation in the roadmap, then add a dedicated task note for that slice and fold the `_assets` metadata boundary into the page-definition task.

I’ve moved the ontology/config slice ahead of the runtime work and added the new task note. I’m doing one quick pass over the edited notes to make sure the sequencing and terminology read cleanly.

Updated the planning docs to make ontology/config modeling the first move rather than a follow-on. The roadmap now puts page-definition vocabulary and `_assets` bundle metadata ahead of the runtime refactor in [[roadmap]].

I also updated the related task work:
- Added [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-08_1735-page-definition-ontology-and-config]] for the ontology/config slice.
- Updated [[wd.task.2026.2026-04-08_1545-resource-page-definition-and-sources]] to depend on that vocabulary work and to capture the `_assets` metadata boundary.

I recorded the `_assets` idea as “bundle-level metadata resource, but not recursive inventory capture.” Small pushback: `AssetFolder` is workable as a placeholder, but I noted that a narrower name like `PageAssetBundle` or `ResourcePageAssetFolder` is probably safer, because generic `AssetFolder` sounds broader than the boundary we actually want.

No tests run; this was documentation-only.

# User_2026-04-08_2333_46

For name "PageAssetBundle " is ok, but it's tied only to Knops right? So maybe KnopPageAssets? or "PerKnopPageAssets"

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2334_02

Yes, if it is only for `_knop/_page/_assets`, the name should probably say so.

I would not use `PerKnopPageAssets`.
It reads like a collection label, not a resource/class, and `Per...` is awkward ontology/config naming.

I also would not use `KnopPageAssets` as the main class name.
The plural makes it sound like “the files themselves,” not the bundle/folder resource that carries metadata.

Best options:

- `KnopPageAssetBundle`
- `KnopPageAssetFolder`
- `ResourcePageAssetBundle`

My preference is `KnopPageAssetBundle`.

Why:
- `Knop` makes the scope explicit
- `PageAsset` says what kind of content it is
- `Bundle` says this is the metadata-bearing container concept, not every child file

If you want a matching property shape, something like:
- `hasKnopPageAssetBundle`
- `knopPageAssetBundle`

If you want to leave room for future non-knop page definitions, then `ResourcePageAssetBundle` is the better abstraction. But if the current boundary is specifically `_knop/_page/_assets`, then `KnopPageAssetBundle` is the clearest name.

# User_2026-04-08_2339_00

I think on general principle hasKnopPageAssetBundle should be used over a capitalization-difference name. Is there anywhere in the 3 current ontologies where the property name only differs by capitalization from a class name?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2339_21

I’m checking the current ontology set directly and searching for class/property pairs that differ only by capitalization, so I can answer this from the actual vocabulary rather than by style instinct.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2339_24

The quick scan hit the three current JSON-LD ontologies you likely meant. `python` isn’t installed here, so I’m rerunning the actual name-collision check with Deno to avoid guessing from eyeballing.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2339_44

I’ve got the raw ontology files. The config ontology has a trailing block comment, so I’m stripping that and doing the actual overlap check now.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2340_11

Yes.

In the three current JSON-LD ontologies under `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology`, I found two class/property pairs that differ only by capitalization, both in [semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld):

- [DefaultShot/](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld#L326) and [defaultShot/](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld#L349)
- [VersioningState/](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld#L409) and [versioningState/](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld#L449)

I did not find that pattern in the current `sflo-config` or `sflo-host` ontologies.

So there is precedent, but it is sparse rather than dominant. I still think your principle is sound: `hasKnopPageAssetBundle` is clearer than relying on capitalization contrast alone.

# User_2026-04-08_2341_51

Can you spawn sub-chats?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2341_58

Yes.

I can spawn sub-agents for well-scoped parallel or delegated work. The useful cases are things like:
- one agent reviews ontology naming
- one agent audits current code paths
- one agent drafts a task/spec note

I would not spawn them by default, but if you want parallel sub-chat work, say what you want split and I can do that.

# User_2026-04-08_2344_57

replace defaultShot with hasDefaultShot andn same for versioningState, and make a note in  ont.dev.guidance about never reusing a class name for a property name.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2345_10

I’m updating the ontology vocabulary and the ontology dev guidance together. First I’m locating every current use of `defaultShot` and `versioningState` so I can rename them cleanly instead of just editing one declaration.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2345_19

The guidance note path in your editor isn’t under the ontology repo root I first checked, so I’m locating the actual file before I edit anything. Then I’ll patch the ontology JSON-LD and the guidance note in one pass.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2345_41

I found the ontology guidance note in the vendored ontology repo, and I also found a second `versioningState/` property in `sflo-prov`. I’m reading the guidance now and then I’ll rename both ontology properties consistently rather than leaving the same smell in two places.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2346_00

I’m patching the ontology files now. I’m keeping the change narrow: rename the properties, update the labels/comments, and add a blunt naming rule to the ontology guidance so we stop recreating the same ambiguity.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2346_14

The rename is in place. I’m doing a quick validation pass now: parse the JSON-LD files, then grep for any remaining live `defaultShot` / `versioningState` property ids in the ontology sources.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2346_26

Renamed the ontology properties and added the naming rule.

Changes:
- [semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld): `defaultShot/` -> `hasDefaultShot/`, `versioningState/` -> `hasVersioningState/`
- [sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/sflo-prov/_payload-flow/_working/sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld): `versioningState/` -> `hasVersioningState/`
- [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md): added a rule to never reuse a class name as a property name with only capitalization changed

Validation:
- Parsed both edited JSON-LD files successfully
- Grepped `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology` and found no remaining live `defaultShot` or `versioningState` property ids

One note: [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md) is currently untracked in that vendored ontology repo.

Suggested commit message:
```text
Rename ambiguous ontology properties to explicit has* forms

- rename defaultShot to hasDefaultShot in semantic-flow ontology
- rename versioningState to hasVersioningState in semantic-flow and sflo-prov ontologies
- add ontology guidance rule against reusing class names as property names with only capitalization differences
```

# User_2026-04-08_2351_01

Did I already commit the ontology changes? Why aren't they listed? Might be spacin

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2351_12

I’m checking both repos directly. The likely issue is that the ontology files were edited in `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology`, while the guidance note I changed was in the vendored copy under `weave/dependencies/...`, so they won’t show up together unless you look at both worktrees.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2351_28

There are two separate issues.

1. No, the ontology property renames are not committed.
In the actual ontology repo, these files are still modified:
- [semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld)
- [sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/sflo-prov/_payload-flow/_working/sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld)

2. The guidance-note change is not showing with them because I edited the vendored copy under `weave/dependencies/...`, not the source ontology repo copy.
Current statuses:
- ontology repo: modified JSON-LD files
- vendored ontology in weave: untracked [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md)
- weave repo itself: unrelated untracked conversation note only

So this is not spacing. It’s repo/path separation, plus I hit the vendored ontology note instead of the source ontology repo note.

If you want, I can fix that now by applying the same guidance-note change in the real ontology repo path and leaving the vendored copy alone or removing it.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2351_34

I’m checking whether the source ontology repo now has its own `notes/ont.dev.guidance.md` path, so I can tell you exactly whether this is a missing-file case or just the wrong file got edited.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2351_40

Confirmed: `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology/notes` does not currently exist on disk.

So the situation is:

- The ontology property renames are real and uncommitted in the source ontology repo:
  - [semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld)
  - [sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/sflo-prov/_payload-flow/_working/sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld)
- The guidance note edit landed only in the vendored copy inside weave:
  - [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md)
- The source ontology repo has no `notes/` directory at the moment, so there is nowhere corresponding for that guidance change to show up there.

So the answer is:
- No, you did not already commit the ontology changes.
- They are not “missing because of spacing.”
- They are split across different repos, and one of the note edits is in the vendored dependency rather than the source ontology repo.

If you want, I can do one of two things next:
1. create `ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md` in the source ontology repo and move the guidance there, or
2. leave guidance only in the vendored copy and keep the source ontology repo limited to the JSON-LD changes.

# User_2026-04-08_2352_38

it's at /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2352_44

Right. That file exists only in the vendored ontology copy under `weave/dependencies/...`, not in the source repo at `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology`.

So if you were looking in the source ontology repo for “all ontology changes,” you would only see:
- [semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/semantic-flow/_payload-flow/_working/semantic-flow-ontology.jsonld)
- [sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld](../../../ontology/sflo-prov/_payload-flow/_working/sflo-prov-ontology.jsonld)

And if you were looking in the vendored dependency copy, you would see:
- [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md)

So nothing disappeared; it’s just split across two different checkout locations. If your intention is to change the canonical ontology repo, then the guidance-note edit is currently in the wrong place.

# User_2026-04-08_2355_00

For our work, we should us the folder that's in dependencies. Can you either replicate your changes into my weave project's dependencies, or commit from the other location and pull here?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2355_09

I’m updating the vendored ontology copy under `weave/dependencies/...` and leaving the source checkout alone. First I’m locating the matching files there so I can mirror the property renames and keep the guidance note in the same repo copy you’re actually working against.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2355_14

The vendored copy only has the guidance note change right now; it does not appear to have the JSON-LD files I edited in the separate ontology checkout. I’m checking what ontology artifacts actually exist in `dependencies/...` so I can mirror the changes into the right files there.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2355_22

The vendored ontology copy is on the newer TTL-based shape, not the JSON-LD files from the separate ontology checkout. So I need to mirror the rename into [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl) and [semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl), not copy the JSON-LD edits verbatim.

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2355_39

Yes. I checked the vendored ontology copy and the situation is:

- The guidance change is already in the dependency copy at [ont.dev.guidance.md](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/notes/ont.dev.guidance.md).
- The property renames from the separate ontology checkout do not have a direct target to replicate into `weave/dependencies/...`, because this vendored copy is on the newer TTL ontology shape:
  - [semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-core-ontology.ttl)
  - [semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology/semantic-flow-prov-ontology.ttl)

Those vendored TTL files do not contain `defaultShot`, `versioningState`, `DefaultShot`, or `VersioningState`, so there is nothing equivalent to rename there.

So, effectively:
- dependency copy: guidance note change is already present
- separate source checkout: JSON-LD rename changes exist, but they are not the files your weave project is actually using

If you want, next I can do one of two cleanup steps:
1. leave the dependency copy as the source of truth and revert the stray edits in `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology`, or
2. keep both, but we should treat the source-checkout edits as out-of-band.

# User_2026-04-08_2359_12

Gotcha. So the real up-to-date ontology is fine. Should we clean up that other checkout? I hate to confuse ya. I Shoulda specified. 

OK, wanna give a prompt for the next conversation?

# gpt-5.4_2026-04-08_2359_38

Yes. I’d clean up the separate `/home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology` checkout or at least stop treating it as active, because for this work the source of truth is the vendored copy at [ontology](../../dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology). Leaving divergent edits in the other checkout is just future confusion.

Prompt for the next conversation:

```text
We are working in /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave.

Important:
- Treat /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/weave/dependencies/github.com/semantic-flow/ontology as the active ontology repo for this work.
- Do not use /home/djradon/hub/semantic-flow/ontology as the source of truth.
- Follow weave/AGENTS.md and the repo documentation guidance.
- Use Dendron wikilinks in notes.
- Avoid hard-wrapping markdown.

Read these first:

Current direction to preserve:
- Ontology/config modeling comes before broad runtime implementation.
- We want a knop-owned page-definition bundle under `_knop/_page`.
- `_knop/_page/_assets` should stay local and ahistorical, but may have bundle-level metadata.
- Do not imply that every file under `_assets` belongs in KnopInventory.
- Each `resourcePageSource` should have its own source/state/mode/fallback policy.
- Prefer `accept` over `prefer` in the policy vocabulary.
- Keep content composition separate from template/chrome policy.
- Runtime should compute nav/breadcrumb/search inputs; templates should render structured inputs.
- Avoid class/property names that differ only by capitalization; prefer explicit `has...` property names.

Task:
Draft the first-pass ontology/config model for customizable identifier pages, including:
- page-definition resource/class naming
- page-region / slot modeling
- `resourcePageSource` and related properties
- per-source state/mode/fallback modeling
- bundle-level `_knop/_page/_assets` metadata resource naming
- which concepts belong in core ontology vs config ontology
- a minimal example RDF shape
- recommended names, with pushback if any current names are weak

Please produce:
1. A concise design recommendation.
2. Specific proposed class/property names.
3. A short list of risks/tradeoffs.
4. Concrete edits or draft text for the relevant ontology/task notes if warranted.
```

If you want, I can also give you a tighter prompt specifically for “draft ontology terms now” versus “discuss naming only.”
